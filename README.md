## Sabrina's Guide to Blogging with Jekyll

This is a handy guide for Sabrina to run her blog locally and update and maintain it.

## Running Development Tasks

Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed, `brew install node`. If the command `brew` isn't found install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

Next we need to have yarn installed:

```
brew install yarn
```

Now we run install on the project directory:

```
$ yarn && yarn start
```

### Serving Jekyll

Jekyll is called for rebuilding from Gulp directly. Make sure you have the latest version: `sudo gem install jekyll`
