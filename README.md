Sabrina's Guide to Blogging with Jekyll
---
This is a handy guide for Sabrina to run her blog locally and update and maintain it.

## Running Gulp

Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed, `brew install node`. If the command `brew` isn't found install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

Next we need to have gulp installed:

```
$ npm install -g gulpjs/gulp#4.0 gulp-cli
```

Now we run install on the project directory:

```
$ npm install && npm start
```

### Serving Jekyll

Jekyll is called for rebuilding from Gulp directly. Make sure you have the latest version: `sudo gem install jekyll`
