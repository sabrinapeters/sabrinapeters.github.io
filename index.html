        <p>Since I <strike>currently work in a public library,</strike> my main responsibility <strike>can be</strike> was easily described as educating those who are computer illiterate, as well as furthering technological literacy in general, with e-readers and tablets becoming more common. I also promoted (I still do!) books, and occasionally helped patrons with research questions.</p>
<p>While I love empowering individuals with the freedom that knowledge brings, my first love has always been research. Curiosity sparks into a flame of questions that will not be quenched until the answers are found. I will sleuth until all the puzzle pieces are found and can be put together.</p>
