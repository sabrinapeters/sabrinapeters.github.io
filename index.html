        <p>I'm a library assistant, researcher, and MLIS student.</p>
        <p>Since I currently work in a public library, my main responsibility can be easily described as educating those who are computer illiterate, as well as furthering technological literacy in general, with e-readers and tablets becoming more common. I also promote books (with the changing roles of librarians these days, yes, I felt I needed to say that) and occasionally help patrons with research questions.</p>
<p>While I love empowering individuals with the freedom that knowledge brings, my first love has always been research. Curiosity sparks into a flame of questions that will not be quenched until the answers are found. I will sleuth until all the puzzle pieces are found and can be put together.</p>
