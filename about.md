Aspiring librarian and agitator for good, who looks at the world through a theological lense most of the time (thanks, seminary!), enjoys walks with [Charles Peters](http://www.charlespeters.net) by the water, has a lot of professional experience with books, writes sometimes, and drinks a lot of kombucha.

Send me a note to learn more.

Peace.
