I'm a library assistant, researcher, and MLIS student at the University of Washington (incoming Fall 2014).

Since I currently work in a public library, my main responsibility can be easily described as educating those who are computer illiterate, as well as furthering technological literacy in general, with e-readers and tablets becoming more common. I also promote books (with the changing roles of librarians these days, yes, I felt I needed to say that :)) and occasionally help patrons with research questions.

While I love empowering individuals with the freedom that knowledge brings, my first love has always been research. Curiosity sparks into a flame of questions that will not be quenched until the answers are found. I will sleuth until all the puzzle pieces are found and can be put together.

They say that those who write must also be readers. I am a reader, yes, but a lazy writer, if at all. Most of my thoughts are connected to worldview, theology, and why people do, say, and think they way they do, say, and think things. My Master of Divinity may not have placed me in a formal position of church ministry, but the training I received in seminary will always influence my thinking.

That being said, what I write is not always related to theology & worldview & books. Sometimes I think I can write short stories, so I try. And sometimes poetry.

My loves include my [husband](http://www.charlespeters.net), good coffee, food, chocolate, sustainable living, poetry, music, art, tulips, the Pacific Northwest, and 30 Rock. There's probably more to that list, but I don't want to spoil it for you.

Dialogue is much more enjoyable than monologue, so I do hope you'll stick around, or send me a note.


Peace.
