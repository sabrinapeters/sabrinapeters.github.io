I'm a MLIS student, bibliophile, and wife.

Since I ~~currently work in a public library,~~ my main responsibility ~~can be~~ was easily described as educating those who are computer illiterate, as well as furthering technological literacy in general, with e-readers and tablets becoming more common. I also promoted (I still do!) books, and occasionally helped patrons with research questions.

While I love empowering individuals with the freedom that knowledge brings, my first love has always been research. Curiosity sparks into a flame of questions that will not be quenched until the answers are found. I will sleuth until all the puzzle pieces are found and can be put together.
