I'm a bibliophile, MDiv, and gentle agitator, seeking to bring down the [kyriarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy).

I have a passion and knack for shepherding people toward the information they need, due to my years of experience in libraries and bookstores. Vocationally, this has me starting on the long path toward ordination. You can join me as I attempt to chronicle this journey, and
living in a mixed-orientation marriage, embracing the poetry of the scriptures.

My husband wants to wear my panties.
