I'm a bibliophile, MDiv, and gentle agitator, working on dismantling the [kyriarchy](https://sdrp.me/2018/01/03/kyriarchy/).

I have a passion and knack for shepherding people toward the information they need, due to my years of experience in libraries and bookstores. Vocationally, this has me starting on the long path toward ordination. You can join me as I attempt to chronicle this journey, think through theology, dismantle the kyriarchy, and read books.
