Many see librarians as having the monopoly on knowledge and resources, but I don't see it that way. Information literacy is a gift meant to be shared. My goal is to hone my library, customer service, and teaching skills in such a way, that if someone can learn something from me, they will easily be able to share that piece of knowledge with the next person, and that person with their friend, and so on, to make the world a better place.
