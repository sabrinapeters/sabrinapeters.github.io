		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I can see why people are protesting The Da Vinci Code, but there are a few things I am wondering about.

1) Picketing at the movie theater....were there picketers at Borders or Barnes &amp; Noble when the book came out?   What about "othercotting"?   The movie is almost never an accurate representation of the book.

2)  Priorities....again, I can understand why people are making such a big thing out of this, but where are their priorities?  Are people going to see the light of the gospel through the protestation of The Da Vinci Code?  Paul, in his imprisonment, rejoiced that the gospel was being preached with very wrong motives: "  So what? Except that in every way, whether with false motives or truth, Christ is proclaimed. And in this I rejoice."  (Philippians 1.18) Now, I'm not in any way saying that the Da Vinci Code is presenting the gospel, but I think books such as those that bring up questions concerning the deity of Christ (namely, the aforementioned) should reveal to us who are true believers the serious need for the spreading of the Good News.  To simply condemn the book/movie for its heretical views will accomplish...what?  The central focus should be the gospel.  I'm not trying to target anyone here, but I just wish more believers would actually stop and think before they do things....it saddens me to see how more and more Christians just fail to think critically....

..I am quite confident that I could keep going off on tangents, but I think that is enough preaching for now.  Thoughts and criticisms welcome.   Chances are I have not thought hard enough, so, enlighten me.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-size:85%;">I wish more "Christian" music artists were more like Keith Green...</span>

 
<blockquote>Do you see, do you see
All the people sinking down
Don't you care, don't you care
Are you gonna let them drown 

How can you be so numb
Not to care if they come
You close your eyes
And pretend the job's done

"Oh bless me Lord, bless me Lord"
You know it's all I ever hear
No one aches, no one hurts
No one even sheds one tear

But He cries, He weeps, He bleeds
And He cares for your needs
And you just lay back
And keep soaking it in,
Oh, can't you see it's such a sin?

Cause He brings people to you door,
And you turn them away
As you smile and say,
"God bless you, be at peace"
And all heaven just weeps
Cause Jesus came to you door
You've left him out on the streets

Open up open up
And give yourself away
You see the need, you hear the cries
So how can you delay

God's calling and you're the one
But like Jonah you run
He's told you to speak
But you keep holding it in,
Oh can't you see it's such a sin?

The world is sleeping in the dark
That the church just can't fight
Cause it's asleep in the light
How can you be so dead
When you've been so well fed
Jesus rose from the grave
And you, you can't even get out of bed

Oh, Jesus rose from the dead
Come on, get out of your bed

How can you be so numb
Not to care if they come
You close your eyes
And pretend the job's done
You close your eyes
And pretend the job's done

Don't close your eyes
Don't pretend the jobs done
Come away, come away, come away with Me my love,
Come away, from this mess, come away with Me, my love.</blockquote>
"Asleep in the Light", from <em>No Compromise</em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just finished <em>Misquoting Jesus</em> tonight.

The first half of the book is informative and interesting; textual criticism introduced in a very basic fashion.

Toward the end of the book, Ehrman's low view of scripture is painfully obvious, with liberal arguments that are not uncommon (i.e., Paul's view of women, Christian anti-Semitism in the early church, etc.)

In his conclusion, he finally ties it together with deconstructionism, in saying that the scribes who were given the task of transmitting/copying the New Testament were merely doing what any one of us does when we read a text; we change it to fit our understanding of life. Here is a portion from page 217,
<blockquote>Texts are interpreted, and they are interpreted (just as they were written) by living, breathing human beings, who can make sense of the texts only by explaining them in light of their other knowledge, explicating their meaning, putting the words of the texts "in other words". 

Once readers put a text in other words, however, they have changed the words. This is not optional when reading; it is not something you can choose <em>not</em> to do when you peruse a text. They only way to make sense of a text is to read it, and the only way to read it is by putting it in other words, and the only way to put in other words is by having other words to put it into, and the only way you have other words to put it into is that you have a life, and the only to have a life is by being filled with desires, longings, needs, wants, beliefs, perspectives, worldviews, opinions, likes, dislikes-and all the other things that make human beings human. <strong>And so to read a text is, necessarily, to change a text.</strong> [my emphasis]</blockquote>
Ehrman is correct at one point-what we read is inherently influenced by our worldview and community. But what he neglects to address (and logically so, right along with his attempt to prove that the books of the NT are not the product of just one Author) is that every text does in fact have an author, and every author had an intention behind his writing.

I would recommend this to someone as a very interesting read, and as an introduction to textual criticism, but with making sure s/he knows where Bart Ehrman is coming from.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After thinking on it for a while (obviously :) ), I have decided to go through 1 Peter and translate.  I have done much of Paul, and some of John, and smatterings of the gospels here and there, so I thought it would be fun to tackle a different writing style.  Be on the look-out for pieces of translation here and there.

Something that has recently caught my interest (I might be a little late in the game, although I have been quite aware of it for a while) is the emergent church.  I have done a little reading, and plan to do more.  I hope more research answers some of my initial queries....

I don’t think there is anything wrong with acknowledging believers in the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, but what happens when Catholic theology (i.e., sola scriptura and scripture+tradition) collides with Protestant theology?  I don’t doubt there may be true believers in the Roman Catholic church, but when its theology is studied closely, it does not reveal a similar soteriology.  Quite the contrary.

The ones who are “searching”, who are “spiritual seekers” yet shun churches religiously (was that a pun? :) no pun intended), will they find what they are looking for in an emergent church?  If the emergent church promotes a plurality of Christianities, so to speak, how will the so-called seeker come to know the Way, the Truth, and the Life?  To provide ridiculously simplistic example, the doctrines of  between the Pentecostal church, say, and the Roman Catholic church contain very vast differences.  Again, while I very much agree that believers from all backgrounds need to stop contending over minor issues, what the emergent church seems to me to be promoting is a pluralism disguised by the church.

There is obviously a lot more to be said, and I plan on reading some of Brian McLaren's works, but if you have more knowledge than I to contribute, by all means do so.  I don't want to give out unnecessary and nonrelevant criticism.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's my first draft, for your enjoyment/criticism/edification/whatever you like:

Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen sojourners of the dispersion throughout Pontus, Galatia, Capadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father by the sanctification of the Spirit, through the obedience of Jesus Christ and sprinkling of His blood, may grace and peace be multiplied unto you.

Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His rich mercy raised us to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, for an inheritance which is incorruptible and pure and unfading, and being kept in heaven for us, which is being guarded by God’s power through faith, for salvation, ready to be revealed on the last day.  In this you rejoice greatly, even though at this present time, for a little while, you are distressed by various trials, so that the testing of your faith, as precious gold ruined by fire, and tested, may be found to the praise and glory and honor in the revelation of Jesus Christ, whom, even though you do not know you love, in whom you believe even though you have not seen Him and rejoice greatly with joy inexpressible and glorious, thereby attaining the outcome of your faith, namely the salvation of your souls.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems as though every time I hear D. James Kennedy on the radio, he's trying to prove that the US was founded upon Christianity.  I suppose there are people who may find inspiration and hope in that if it were true.  But I don't know if it is.  Ah!  There are too many things to study and not enough time.  There are also a lot of things I want to complain about, but I don't wish to turn this blog into an outlet for such things.

There have been many things on my mind lately, especially about my post-B.A. life!  Wheaton looks really tantalizing, but, honestly, what could a girl do with an MA in Biblical Exegesis without going on to a PhD?  I don't find myself to be made of professor material.

As soon as I finish 1 Peter 1, I will try to come up with some comments on the chapter, and so on with the rest of the chapters.  This may take me more than just the summertime, but it will be profitable in more ways than one.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Is there a difference between a woman teaching in the church and a woman Bible professor?  I saw that Wheaton has a female prof in the Bible department, and it got me thinking.  1 Timothy 2 does not differentiate between school and church, so it seems to be more of a cultural issue...or is it?

School denotes knowledge in of itself, but everyone in a position of leadership has influence in the way of worldview and philosophy, etc.  A Bible teacher is always going to have some spiritual influence over his/her students, so does that mean that a female Bible professor would be violating Paul's command?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've also been thinking about the idea of "liking" a church the past few days.  What does that even mean?  After all, in the days of the early church, its members probably did not have a choice in the matter of "like" or "dislike".  They were family, and they stuck together.  If one of its members got kicked out,]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently I read a post by Tim Challies on mysticism, interacting with a paper Dr. Whitney presented at an ETS meeting several years back. Challies argues that mysticism is outside of the boundaries of evangelicalism, because those boundaries go beyond the text of Scripture. The only experiences of God that are valid then, must be validated by what scripture says about God and how believers in scripture experienced him.

And then I think to myself, I must not be evangelical.

Why?

Because I wholeheartedly support the use of different spiritual disciplines that are not found recorded in the Bible, based on this premise: not one individual is like the other.

Everyone has been created with different personalities, physical traits, skills, talents, abilities, gifts, and so the list goes on. You won't find two individuals who are exactly alike. They may be close, but not completely identical. Moreso, because everybody is different, we relate differently to people. If we can relate so differently to people, even differently to each person we meet, how is it that we are restricted in our experiences and relation to God based on what scripture records? Yes, we read scripture and pray, and should always, but the ways in which we pray and read scripture and experience God vary from individual to individual. God created personality and individuality, and it matters in relationship to him.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a follow-up to my post "<a href="http://www.sabrina-peters.net/living-in-jerrytown">living in jerrytown</a>", I thought I would share some things I enjoy about living in Lynchburg specifically, and the South/East Coast, in general.

-History. The West is a young part of the USA, so I feel like I am just now catching up with parts of history, such as the Civil War. I knew it happened, but never having seen any of the related landmarks made it easy to hold as an abstract concept. There are historical landmarks less than one mile away from where I live, from the Civil War era. There is also the site of the first Quaker meeting house in Lynchburg, established in the seventeenth century, less than a mile away. Simply put, Virginia tells more stories of the USA's origins that I've yet to explore in an interactive manner.

-Related the history, I love all the grand, old architecture, and more specifically, all the old church buildings in Lynchburg. Some are more humble looking, while others are just magnificent, but they are beautiful.

-I grew up in the desert, and then spent the last several years in its antithesis: the Evergreen State. My eyes had known no happy medium until now. I love the sights of the prolific flora, especially when all the tulips are in bloom, and the old, proud tree that stands in the courtyard. As to whether Lynchburg has definitive seasons, I am not sure.

-Comfortable or not, the Southerner's friendliness is a plus. It might even take some of the edge off of this culture shock.

-Church of the Good Shepherd.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A thought struck me the other day, as I was listening to a lecture on "Dog and Cat Theology" by an alumnus of Dallas Theological Seminary.

The people of the USofA are very much like the Israelites of the Old Testament.

Many Americans claim to believe in God, but many refuse responsibility by supposedly being accepting of all religions and ways of thought (though if you would ask someone like this, s/he would probably point out a better way than all the rest, so there is no avoiding exclusivism).  Many could care less about their eternal destiny, and live life to its materialistic full.  Most of all, many American citizens are only concerning with themselves, and living how they please.

Enter 9/11/01.  The people of the US seem to remember God upon the occurence of tragedy and death and terrorism and pain.

Where is God now?  Megachurches are booming because people seek entertainment and gratification.  What can God do for <em>me</em>?  Seems like a cat to me.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems I've been quite the slacker this summer.  I had better intentions for this blog, and I regret now not having put the time that summer normally gives into this blog.  My apologies to the few who would actually read this :).  I hope to get things rolling again this week, although it may be a little slow.

To top things off, I've been unexpectedly :) tagged by Cliff, or as students of DrV(arner) know him, Clive.  :)

1. One book that changed your life.

Well, of course the Bible.  I'm tempted to leave it at that because I have such a hard time making decisions :).  Um, probably <em>Basics of Biblical Greek</em>.

2. One book that you’ve read more than once.

Hehe.  Can I be completely random?  <em>Eating Well for Optimum Health</em>

3. One book you’d want on a desert island.

Just one?  How horrible.  That's depressing, if you ask me.  I'd definitely want my Bible.  If I had the entire vocab of the Greek NT memorized I might take that.  Maybe <em> Is There a Meaning in This Text?</em>

4. One book that made you laugh.

I remember when I used to read a lot of novels.  With my sense of humor, however, I can usually find something to laugh at in 80% of the books I read.

5. One book that made you cry.

It was probably a novel.

6. One book that you wish had been written.

Well, right now I'm wishing someone would have written a flawless commentary of Revelation.  **EDIT**  According to Cliff (and thank you), flawless commentaries <em>have</em> been written.  So now I have to change my answer.  Or should I?  I don't have an infinite knowledge of books.  Oh, I know.  <em>How to Survive First Year Hebrew with Dr. Boyd</em>

7. One book that you wish had never been written.

<em>Jesus and Buddha</em>

8. One book you’re currently reading.

<em>Text of the New Testament</em>

9. One book you’ve been meaning to read.

A meaningful book or just a book?  I enjoy being random. <em> A Generous Orthodoxy </em>,  <em>God, Language and Scripture </em>,  <em> Crime and Punishment </em> (which I started, but never finished).

10. Now tag five people.
Who is left to tag?  If you happen to read this and haven't done it yet, consider yourself tagged.

It would seem that the obvious answer to the vast majority of these questions is..."Bible"....hmm...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, now that school has officially begun, the struggle to update my blog with thoughful blurbs has now intensified.  I am taking five classes,
-Exegesis of Romans (DrV is by far my most favorite professor)
-Early Christian Literature (see above)
-Senior Seminar
-Foundations of Science
-Message Preparation for Women (incidentally, we will be giving messages from Philippians, which I studied last semester in my Greek exegesis class).

Aside from these classes, I will be studying for the GRE and the senior competency bible exam.

I miss not having two Greek classes.  Romans is my last Greek class, and the only one I am taking this semester.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently read a book by Gene Edward Veith.  In the book he mainly summarizes and expounds upon what Luther to say about vocation.  Even though much of the book was not new material for me, it reminded me of a few things I thought I might share:

1)  God’s sovereignty.
It is very true; sad, but true, that I take most seemingly mundane things in life for granted.  To put it in other words, I forgot that God is sovereign, that He owns the cattle on a thousand hill, that He holds the world in the palm of His hand, that He is in complete control of everything.  Instead, in my mind I see the things I do to take care of myself.  How often I have heard the sovereignty of YHWH preached from the pulpit, in books, and read in His word, yet I always end up the center of my little universe.  Thus on the very first page of the chapter entitled “How God Works Through Human Beings” where I read “God healed me…God talked to me…God fed me…God clothed and sheltered me…God protected me…God give me pleasure” , I was immediately convicted of the fact that I do not view people within their different vocations as God’s instruments, and that it is God who ultimately takes care of me.  This was probably one of my favorite chapters in the book, because it presented God’s sovereignty in a way I had never thought before.  I was also reminded that earthly rulers and authorities are God’s instruments.  I daresay I will continue to need more reminders, because since everyone is a sinner, it is too easy to get caught up in pointing out someone’s faults, and complaining about their use of God-given authority.

2)  God’s calling.
Vocation in the Christian sense, or as Veith describes it through Luther, is something I heard of once or twice, and practically disregarded.  Having grown up in the church, I have heard of God’s “calling”, and always associated it with one vocation (generally speaking) in life, namely, a career (i.e., motherhood, ministry, missions).  I never associated God’s calling with my present situation.  The poignant reminder that God’s calling is my vocation, that my vocation is more than one, and that my vocation(s) are here and now, motivates me to strive harder for excellency, and to work for God, not for men, no matter how mundane and earthly the task at hand may be.  I also regard my situation as more sacred, and it causes me to pause and consider how well I am using my time, as to walk carefully, because the days are evil.

3)  My calling as a worker.
The chapter entitled “Your Calling as a Worker” struck me hard as well, because all summer I had been struggling with laziness, wasted time, and service, in regard to my job.   It was emphasized in this book that our good works are used for serving others.  Honestly, I had never heard it put this way.  My work at my job, serving others?  Isn’t work about putting in good effort for the money one makes?  Again, I can see how earthly my thinking is, and very selfish it is.  My occupation is not just about me, it is about others and how I can serve them.  If I am struggling with laziness, wasted time, and slow service, then am I really being a good servant with the time and resources I am given?  Am I really looking out for other’s interests?  I think the answer is “no”, and to re-think my work as a service to others and not for myself (because I am making money, etc.), was really sobering, because it made me realize that not only was I not being a good worker, I was wasting one of my opportunities to imitate Jesus and be a servant in everything that I do in relation to others.  Not only am I serving the people who benefit from my work, but I am serving my boss, because of the assistance I am providing.  Ever since reading that chapter, it has been my prayer every morning for the Lord to give me the heart of a servant, and to do so with a right attitude.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Does anyone know how to best witness to a Nichiren Buddhist?  I can clearly see (by what has been explained to me so far by a devotee of 50 years) that a huge problem is logic, and I can address those issues; however, I have almost no experience witnessing to followers of Eastern philosophy.  I'm think the best approach might be more philosophical in the beginning, and then pointing to scripture.

If anyone has any helpful input, it would be greatly appreciated.

I've also been discovering that one does not need to go overseas to do cross-cultural missions.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It disappoints me that so many people, especially those relative to my age, and Christians to boot (although I'm not surprised), don't come to school to learn.  They come to school to make money, but are sent by their parents to get "an education".

"Just tell me what I need to know to pass thetest."

I also commend those who continue to teach what they love, in spite of those supremely uninterested students.  That would easily discourage me.  I want to be able to teach so that my students will come to love the subject, not so they can pass the test.

Yet...this how most Americans treat Christianity, is it not?  "Just tell me what I need to know to pass..."

Jesus did say that He would spit the lukewarm out of His mouth.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been using the gospel of Judas to my advantage, not to mention the gospel of Thomas.

I've been encouraged by the fact that even though the early Apologists could utilize almost any type of argument in the apologia of Christianity, they always pointed to the character of the Christians.  In another way, this also causes some disappointment within me, because the Christians whose character is not so Christ-like always stick out more.  This is why I'm hesitant to use the word "Christian".  Any thoughts on that?]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was talking to my roommate the other day.  She has some interesting viewpoints; ones that I had not heard before.  I'm not usually one to discuss politics, but I am interested in different viewpoints.

She is a pacifist, and she is more.  Or is she?  I knew what pacificsm was, but I had not heard it explained.  Of course, I was not surprised that she used Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2 to defend her position, but there are a few things she said I have been thinking about.  I'm not quoting her statements, only summarizing them.

"Obedience is not the same thing as submission."
I'm still thinking this through.  Are they really mutually exclusive?  Can they be?

"Christians are too concerned with their rights."
Now, I can agree with this in a sense.  Humans in general are pre-disposed to selfishness.  Christians can be overzealous in fighting for political rights-I believe I mentioned something like this in another entry.  But are Christians really to do nothing about the privileges that come with being a citizen?  Didn't Paul appeal to his rights as a Roman citizen?  Why did Justin Martyr write in the defense of Christians?

"In the Old Testament, God gave specific instructions for war...that hasn't happened since...therefore, war is wrong."
I don't know about this one.

"Voting doesn't matter...immorality is going to become rampant in its own time....it doesn't matter who is office."
True, God is sovereign.  But the obvious question is, what about being a responsible citizen within the type of government one is under?  Are Christians not supposed to be involved in government?  Is it wrong for Christians to hold various offices for the purpose of enforcing moral, Christian values?  Should Christians just stand back and do nothing?

A lot of questions to answer.  Are there concrete answers?  Can we legitimately take Paul's idea of submission and apply it to every form of contemporary government?

I'm afraid I don't have all the answers.  But I can tell you I'll be looking for answers, and if I find something worth sharing, I'll share it.  In the meantime, please let me know what your thoughts are.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is probably not new, but I got to thinking about pluralism and postmodernity, and how nothing new is under the sun.

The Romans and Greeks had their plurality of deities.  Just the same, everyone on earth worships something, and probably not just one thing.  Deities. They claim that they "tolerate" other beliefs, as well.

The Romans had their lord, the caesar, who was human and sinful.  In a similar sense, everyone has their lord, and it is either themself, someone else, or something else.  It doesn't have to be tangible, but it is something that can be realized through the mundane.  It can (and almost always) serves the lust for control.

Along comes the Christian, who claims that there is only one Theos, one Kurios, YHWH.  He cannot be seen, and He does not cater to fleshly desires.  Early believers were tortured and killed in numerous ways for not acknowledging a caesar as lord.

What believers are struggling with today relates in like manner....we do not acknowledge man as God, therfore the world ridicules us for not being "tolerant" of other's belief systems.

I sense many people becoming a little nervous about the whole postmodern deal, which is right and just, but it needs to be realized by all that this is just Satan's prolonged battle with God under new names.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So sorry, peeps.  I left a mysterious note last time, and meant to expand on it pretty quickly (but I forgot).  Here's a little update on life.

After expressing my desire to my Greek professor to study further for the purpose of teaching/missions/ministry, he encouraged me in that regard, and recommended Wheaton (which still is, academically speaking, my school of choice).  Having already signed up to go visit this little, tiny seminary in Washington, I said that I would look into Wheaton (because I really wanted to [and especially the Billy Graham scholarship, which would be the only way that I would attend the school]).  I also wanted to visit the school because I am a bit nervous of studying somewhere I've never been.

Well, I ended up visiting Northwest Baptist Seminary in Tacoma, WA, and shortly thereafter my finances (or rather lack thereof) prevented me from even considering a short visit to Wheaton.  Drat, because I really like the look of their Biblical Exegesis program.  And another catch was that I couldn't guarantee going on the mission field after I graduated, so I'd have to pay back the Billy Graham "scholarship" (which is actually a loan, paid off for you when you spend a few years on the mission field post graduation).

I really do not have the desire to go to a state university (where I would major in Linguistics/TESOL), and Seattle Pacific University (where I would also study linguistics) would not give me any help financially (their TESOL curricula looked very good).

To make the story a bit shorter, I decided to apply to Northwest Baptist Seminary (which also has a scholarship [a genuinely free one] available).

One of the main reasons I've applied there is because they are really strong in the area of Biblical languages (even if I was not going to attend Wheaton, I'd still want to ensure that I get something almost as good in that department).  I've also applied because the scholarship would assist me greatly, and because I am really fond of Washington's greenery (never mind the rain-I love that, as well), having grown up mostly in desert-like surroundings.

There you have it :).

I have a little more time on my hands this semester, so another blurb should be coming soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just discovered that there are two different prominent churches in the States with the name "Mars Hill".

I am afraid that before a few days ago, when I was reading <span style="font-style:italic;">A New Kind of Christian, </span>I had confused the two churches.

I got a feel for Mars Hill in Seattle when I visited, and think that I would be content there, but I'm not so sure about Mars Hill Bible Church.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[...quite a few places, actually!  Along with working (I picked up a sort of nannying job), and working for my rent (I log hours in lieu of checks for the room I rent...for an awesome family), studying for my CLEP exams, helping at Good News Club, preparing for graduation, trying to study some Japanese, trying to visit the gym every now and then....

I went to Salt Lake City, Utah last month, from March 10-17.  I wrote up a report that I'll try to get posted on here; if not, then I'll try to summarize in a blog or two.

Shortly after I got back from Utah, I left for a week's length excursion to Tacoma, Washington.  After much prayer, and consideration (and contemplation), I applied to Northwest Baptist Seminary.  I was accepted, and offered a scholarship.  After more prayer, I accepted the scholarship, and the doors have been opening ever since for my being able to attend there in the fall.  Lord willing, I'll be relocating to Washington in June to start working.  In September, I'll start working toward an MDiv.  Immense pressure or not, I will love having classes again, and studying with people who are serious and committed.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever experienced refreshment in participating in a “small group/bible study”, wherein most of the participants’ theology left much to be desired...yet, you longed to go back, because of the love of Christ and fellowship offered there (well, and because you really, really wanted to help with basic theology)?  I have.

I am always wondering about those people being criticized for having poor doctrine, and those who are boasting sound doctrine and sound living, yet doing nothing to spread the love of Christ -- reaching out to the lost.  Those who proclaim scriptural principles, but live in a pure dogmatic sense.  Which is better--theology or love?  Christ in the pulpit/classroom, or Christ in the streets?

Jesus preached, AND served.  What about us?  What does it matter that we simply embrace the gospel and preach it (not necessarily with words), without correct theology?  The depravity of humankind is evident in prideful boasting.

Although I am fascinated with theology, I find myself backing away from theological arguments which do not pertain to someone’s salvation.  I pray daily for the love of Christ.  I am frustrated with churches that have every theological T crossed, and refuse to exercise them with love.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So many of them!

-New state, new city, new people.
-Graduate level studies, as opposed to undergrad.
-Living with just one roommate in a quaint apartment, as opposed to living with five or six other people in a house, or 79 other girls in a dormitory.
-Having to actually pay rent (I worked for a room previously).
-Looking for a new church in a completely different environment (I've heard it said that Pierce County [where I now reside], is the least churched county in the entire nation; although I haven't been able to verify that, I've noticed that most churches seem to have smaller congregations).
-Trying to change my Southern California driving instincts is not so easy.
-And for the sake of my family and many friends back in California, I'll make this blog more of a personal chronicle, along with my usual random stuff.

....did I mention the weather is in stark contrast to California right now?  I love this weather.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've now been living in Tacoma, WA for 10 days.

After I unpacked all my books, I started to feel at home, although I don't know where I'll keep the books I collect while in my three-year seminary experience (I think I may decorate this little place with bookshelves).  That "at-home" feeling grew as I became more able to navigate around "T-town", so they call it.  And tonight I cooked my first meal, so I'm feeling mostly settled.

My family hung out with me last week, and we had fun going places and doing things.

Out of my unending curiosity for churches "emerging", I visited <a href="http://www.somacommunities.com">Soma church.</a> This area has a wealth of Baptist churches, and what seems to be popular are GARBC churches ("GARB", as everyone calls them: General Association for Regular Baptist  Churches).  I tend to feel uncomfortable in denominational churches with a strict doctrinal statement (which is why I like <a href="http://www.efca.org">EV Free churches</a>-their doctrinal statement has room for a bit of freedom), so I don't know whether I'll end up in a Baptist church or not.  I liked Soma, but I suspect it'll take more than a couple attendances to know what they are really up to.

I'll be taking a summer class, <span style="font-style:italic;">Interpretive Insights from the Land of the Bible</span>.  It's basically a Bible geography course, the closest thing to an excursion to Israel for me, I suppose, although I still long for a trip to the Holy Land.  It's two weeks in length, so we'll see how much I actually retain.

For the fall quarter, I'll be taking Greek, Hebrew, Hermeneutics, and Theological Research &amp; Writing.

I have a hunch I've landed a job at the local Christian bookstore.  It won't be paying much, but it's a start.  I'm not in control of my own life, and I was sorely reminded of that fact when in a slight occurrence of absent-mindedness, I locked myself out of my car at a gas station, with nothing in my hands except a skinny gas card.  Another story for another time.

At any rate, God has seen it fit to keep me here, and He'll continue to provide as He sees fit.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Church Hunt</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Searching for a church to belong to in an area I'm unfamiliar with has really made me think about what characteristics are important to have in a local body of believers.  When I moved to attend The Master's College, I received much help in the church hunt, because churches were both numerous and had numbers of attendees.  All I had to do was talk to a classmate to find out additional information.

I ponder such things as these...

"Well, this church seems really good.  There are lots of people my age (which is nice for fellowshi), the messages are applicable and biblical, there are plenty of opportunities to serve within the community.  BUT it's kind of large.  I was able to walk in and out of the service without talking to anyone, besides thanking the guy who held a door open for me.  Do I like that?  Would I feel comfortable having to make myself known to people, is it my responsibility?  Or is it the congregation's?  Another thing is, many of the people there are artistic free spirits.  Would I blend in?

"And I really feel at home in this other church.  It's smaller, and they've practically invited me to serve with them already, in more than just one facet, even before I moved up here.  But there's hardly anyone my age--I'm stuck in the middle.   Their preaching and doctrine is sound, and I love that.

"My roommate's church seems cool.  It's smaller, and they really reach out to the community by having a food giveaway every Saturday, and free flea markets every once in a  while.  The only thing that bothers me just a little, is that the paster (a she) takes John 10.10 ("life abundantly") to speak of material things.  Her reasoning for having wealth is okay (to spread the good news), but God has not ordained everyone for prosperity.  To give and give, and tell people that why they are giving is because everyone is supposed to be rich...I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.  Not to say I don't rejoice in the fact that this church is reaching out to its neighbors!!  Praise God for that."

So you can see I'm dealing with a few issues.

-opportunities to serve
-interpretation of Scripture
-fellowship

And I think those issues are key things in churches.  I just have to figure which things are more important, and which things I can sacrifice just a little.

*EDIT* Please let me know when I make an atrocious grammatical error!! :-)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, just to clarify some things for those who are wondering....

I wasn't thinking about attending the church where there is a husband-wife pastor-team.  I was just using three churches as an example of what kinds of things to look for in a church, and what kinds of things <span style="font-weight:bold;">not </span>to look for.  Sorry if I implied differently!

If things keep going the way they are, I'll probably stick with <a href="http://tacoma.somacommunities.org">Soma</a>

I've been able to meet people and start building relationships.  I've also accidentally managed to volunteer service in the area of cleaning the church building..."accidentally", because I talked to the person in charge, but forgot to mention I was interested.  Next thing you know, she's calling me because I had expressed interest in helping!  Funny how God works.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't remember ever touching on this subject before, but I think it needs addressing.

I’m a girl, in seminary.  What of it?

I’m in my mid-twenties, single, with hardly any “prospects in sight.”  What of it?

I love kids, and love discipling them.  What of it?  Does that mean I should be a mom?

Why do people seem to think that ________ would really, really profit from marriage?

Why can’t I hang out with a friend of the opposite gender without it having to be a “date”?

What are you people thinking?

No, I’m not angry.  I’m just very intrigued by this mindset, because it does not leave much room for creativity or imagination.

So what if I’m studying in seminary with a bunch of men and only a few other women?  Does that make me a little too weird?  What if I don’t manage to obtain that “MRS” degree by the time I graduate?  Does that mean something is wrong with me?

Come on.  Expand your one-track mind.

Just because you think I’m marriage material, or __________, or whatever, doesn’t mean I should be trying harder now that I’m halfway between 20 and 30.

And just because I hung with that person does not mean we went on a “date”.  Please use your imagination.  Can’t I be friends with those who are not girls?

I appreciate the freedom I have.  It is definitely a gift to make the most of.  And I admit, sometimes I wonder what marriage would be like, though in my mind, it does not outweigh being unattached. The closet romantic in me would scream in protest, saying,  isn’t love the most beautiful thing?  You tell me.

Don’t misunderstand me.  I’m not belittling marriage (it has great symbolic significance), although it would be nice to be reminded of its benefits, because I seem to have forgotten what people have tried to convince me of. I’m not saying that I would purposefully reject marriage (or a relationship) for no good reason.  I welcome whatever God has for me.  I want to go with the flow, which means not trying to swim ahead of things.  Don’t try to confuse me into thinking that marriage should be my goal in life, because it might cut off my grove.  I’m having a nice swim.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dang it.

It is too easy to let things slip even a little.

Taking my gaze off the goal, and letting it linger off to the side for what seems to be a short time, only to find that when I try to fix my gaze back on the goal, a spoon of discontentment has already been fed to my mind, heart.

That distraction leads to a complete, 100% lackadaisical approach to the here and now, which in turn leads to poor stewardship of the gifts I have been loaned to use where I am, right now.

I feel utterly <span style="font-style:italic;">un</span>motivated to do anything right now.  And it's all my fault.  And it's sin.]]></content:encoded>

Outside, overlooking the water.

Accompanied by autumn colored trees, blue sky, white clouds and sunshine.

While breathing prayers, a wave of calm washed over me.  My anxieties dissipated.

No wonder Jesus sought time in communion with the Father, alone, for hours at a time.  You can’t run through life without stopping to even have a time of <span style="font-style:italic;">thought</span> in solitude, let alone <span style="font-style:italic;">prayer</span>, which goes without saying.  But even with preaching that last phrase, I would be the biggest hypocrite.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am driving up 85 in the
Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
I'm just stuck inside the gloom

4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

Cause I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life
Am I living it right
Am I living it right
Am I living it right
Why, why georgia, why

I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel alone

It might be a quarter-life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul
Either way

I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life
Am I living it right
Am I living it right
Am I living it right
Why, why georgia, why

So what so I've got a smile on
It's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head

Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down

Everybody is just a stranger
But that's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's a price I have to pay
Still everything happens for a reason
Is no reason not to ask myself
If I'm living it right

Am I living it right
Am I living it right
Why, why georgia, why

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[i feel as though i've reached one pinnacle in my cynicism and loathing of consumerism.  nope, no christmas gifts for you.  at least, not the kind that you think.

it's a fairly romantic and tragic irony....because i work in "christian retail", and it is now the busiest season for those businesses.  i'm supposed to be selling stuff, not complaining about stuff.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You should know better than to say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to the city. We will do business there for a year and make a lot of money!" What do you know about tomorrow? How can you be so sure about your life? It is nothing more than mist that appears for only a little while before it disappears. You should say, "If the Lord lets us live, we will do these things." Yet you are stupid enough to brag, and it is wrong to be so proud. If you don't do what you know is right, you have sinned.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A year ago, I was busily preparing myself for seminary, as I began to develop a plan for my life:

-Finish grad school with an MDiv.

-Become TESOL certified.

-Teach English to speakers of other languages until my loans were paid off.

-Teach and church-plant and disciple, etc. in some foreign country until I died.

(what about marriage?  you ask.  oh yeah, maybe that too.)

Two months ago, I was wrapping up my first quarter at seminary, feeling quite exhausted.
Two weeks into the second quarter, illness hits.
That was over three weeks ago, and I have not been to class since.
I hesitate to say what I’m gonna do next.  Only God knows.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-family:lucida grande;">"Jesus in New Orleans"</span>

 

<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">The last time I saw Jesus
I was drinking bloody mary's in the South
In a barroom in New Orleans
Rinsin' out the bad taste in my mouth</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">She wore a dark and faded blazer
With a little of the lining hanging out
When the jukebox played Miss Dorothy Moore
I knew that it was him without a doubt</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">I said the road is my redeemer
I never know just what on earth I'll find
In the faces of a stranger
In the dark and weary corners of a mind</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">She said, The last highway is only
As far away as you are from yourself
And no matter just how bad it gets
It does no good to blame somebody else</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">Ain't it crazy
What's revealed when you're not looking all that close
Ain't it crazy
How we put to death the ones we need the most</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">I know I'm not a martyr
I've never died for anyone but me
The last frontier is only
The stranger in the mirror that I see</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">But when I least expect it
Here and there I see my savior's face
He's still my favorite loser
Falling for the entire human race</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;"><span style="font-size:100%;">-Ohio</span>
</span>

<span style="font-family:lucida grande;">

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Art and the Bible </em>
p16

"...if Christianity is really true, then it involves the whole man, including his intellect and creativeness.
Christianity is not <em>just </em>'dogmatically' true or 'doctrinally' true.
Rather, it is true to what is there, true in the whole area of the whole man in all of life."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">It's as though she'd been kept in a cage, and the cage was composed of spoken and unspoken rules and regulations and expectations from a certain book, and peering in were those ready to pounce the very second she escaped, using the Book as a weapon. </span>

<span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">But somehow, she managed a taste of freedom.  It tasted good.  Very good.  And in the meantime, she discovered that the "right" and the "wrong" was, in fact, not from the Book at all, but from people.

Just people.

...certain "christian" bookstores are "christian" in name only.  and why everything is about money.

take a look at this t-shirt.

it is due to come out in my work's latest sale catalog.

last night, at the latest staff meeting, my boss announced that everything in the catalog had been ordered, except for this shirt.

the reason?  she was "offended" by the image of jesus on a cross, spilling out blood and gore.  she wasn't going to order it, unless someone specially requested it.

now, i know that my boss does not want to be associated with some catholics who <span style="font-style:italic;">may </span>take crucifixes a bit too far, but to throw out the atonement is to throw out the gospel.  jesus died on a cross to bear the wrath you and i deserved.  and you are offended at the sight?   god help us.

i do not work at a "christian" bookstore.  i knew that before, but it is becoming more and more evident even to those who thought a christian bookstore (a "christian" <span style="font-style:italic;">anything</span>) on this planet even existed.  i work at a bookstore.  just a bookstore owned by people with christian morals, fighting for moral lifestyles, and nothing more.  it is no more sacred than borders.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[i didn't realize how anti-cultural (is that a word?  probably not) it would be to go without my car.   it's a whole new world.

it's too easy to ignore what society considers the lowly by just zipping around,
minding one's own business,
riding inside a bubble,
feeling oh-so-safe.

i don't think i've been asked for money more in my life than in the past 2 weeks.  i don't think i've seen more pain and poverty, whether self-inflicted or other-inflicted, whether living on the street or off the street, whether verbalized or not.

not only do automobiles contribute to laziness, but they also contribute to the freakin' individualism we westerners are too familiar with.
(wait a second, no, not the automobiles.
it's the fact that people drive 'em.)

we're called to help the hurting, but how can we help those whom we can't even see?  pay attention, people.  i'm going to try harder.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay peeps...it’ll take too long to relate the past four months in detail, so here is a summarized timeline.

<span>-June...was a cool month.  school ended, and i got to visit the fam down in soCal.</span>

<span>-July...pretty boring, except for the 4</span><span><sup>th</sup></span><span>.</span>

<span>-August...began as another tedious working month, until i got the idea to travel to london in the fall.  that idea soon unraveled into an opportunity to LIVE in london, which i snagged with almost no hesitation.</span>

<span>-September...very, very interesting month.  the 1</span><span><sup>st</sup></span><span> was my fly-out-of-the-county date.  I flew out of seattle that night, and arrived in london on the 2</span><span><sup>nd</sup></span><span>, only to be sent back 12 hours later. (shoot me an email for details).  so, plan A was shot down, and poor summer was without an au pair.  problem was, i didn’t have a plan B, mainly because i am naïve and sometimes idealistic.  so here i am, back in seattle 48 hours after i tried to escape.  i have some very gracious friends who offered to take me in, and i stayed with them for 5 days.</span>

<span>now, guess where i am.  try.</span>

<span>you got it.</span>

<span>the very </span><span>place</span><span> i’ve been trying to avoid ever since i fled**. </span>

<span>the place i grew up in.  the dry, dusty, deserty, windy, two-seasony, joshua-tree-prolificacy, dirty, hick-y,….ugh.  hesperia, ca.  the place where riding your dirt bike is the THING to do on weekends.  don’t get me wrong; i love my friends and family, but….hesperia.  why??</span>

<span>God really has a sense of humor, folks.  So, stay tuned as i develop a plan B.</span>

 

<span>** well, not really...try “evaded”...hmm, actually, that doesn’t work, either.  i did move away to school, where i discovered much better places.  let’s leave it at that.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[you know, the more weddings i go to, the more expensive &amp; elaborate they seem.  i told my mom that the more weddings i attend, the less i want to have one.

i seriously wouldn't mind just eloping, and then throwing a party later.  why not use the money for a good cause?

but then i would have some pretty annoyed friends... and not to mention, family.  likewise, there are more than a few people who would say marriage involves community, and including one's community as a witness of the marriage covenant is a non negotiable.

thoughts?]]></content:encoded>

i'm always on the look out for something fresh, eclectic, and not overly "poppy" (i detest pop music).  if you have any other suggestions, please make them.

cheers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know, I know, it's been a long time.  I've been stressing over piano and people.  It's what happens when one volunteers their mediocre playing skills for the church over christmas time.  It's also what happens when you have close friends.

Beginning tomorrow, for roughly 24 hours, I will be hanging out on the famous route of the rose parade.  I will be following a large group of people intent upon street evangelizing the day before the parade.  An opportune moment, yes?  Some of them will merely be miming/dramatizing to music containing bits (or all) of the gospel message, and some of them will be "preaching."

Why will I only be following?  Well, for one thing I will be documenting stuff on film, literally.  For another thing, I don't really like "street evangelizing."

Whoops.  Did I actually write that?  On the public domain of the world wide web where most of my readers claim Christianity?  I'm afraid I did, which leads to the main point/question of this little blog:

What's my problem with street evangelizing?

Okay, admittedly, maybe it's not my "gift", per se.  That's a slightly legitimate reason.  But what else bothers me is that most who are evangelized on the street, once having "accepted Jesus" (i'm struggling with most christian-ese at this point in my life), are left quite alone, without discipleship, and, well, alone, still adrift in their world.  Is it safe to say they are really saved?  I'm not the Judge, but I think about this a lot, and  I have the same issues with altar calls.

So before you become quite annoyed with me for taking issue with something that is quite traditional in the church realm, let me clarify that I don't believe street evangelizing is inherently bad, for God can choose any method He pleases to draw one to Himself, I'm sure there are many who go about street witnessing with care and wisdom, and I am certain there are those who would not have heard about Jesus otherwise.  I'm just pointing out something I have noticed in my short life span that could use more attention.

Am I wrong in this in any way?  I would like to be corrected if I am.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The other night, about 20 minutes after I go to bed (around 1:30 am), light penetrates the dark hallway.  

I am occupying my parent's bed, because they are gone on a retreat in the mountains.  You know, married couples' time.  My twin brothers' room is right across the hallway, and that's where the light comes from.  I hear a strange sound (I later find out it's my brother's labored, sporadic breathing), and a forceful, worried "breathe, C----, breathe!" (Apparently, he had stopped breathing for fifteen seconds, and his twin, Z, was somewhat frightened.  I would be, too.)  

Then in an urgent, raised voice sounds out "Sabrina!  Get a cold glass of water or something!"  

"Why?"  I ask, dreading the one-word answer.  "Seizure!"  So I stumble down the hallway (this is actually quite comical, because I am still in my sleeping bag, which I shed halfway down the way), pounding on my 22 year old brother's door on the way down to the kitchen.  By the time I return to the room, plastic cup of water in hand, the poor boy is being turned over to his side to ease the complications of very labored breathing that seizures bring.  As we three siblings all stand around his bed, anxiously awaiting the ceasing of the seize, he moans and tries to move.  We speak to him, and he looks at us, eyes wide open, not understanding.  After his seizure is gone, I speak to him as he looks for his pillow, and he looks at me, but doesn't respond.  His pupils are dilated.  His gaze is blank.  Finally, after getting him his pillow and being satisfied that he could relax, we all go back to bed.  

Fifteen minutes later, I am still trying to sleep.  I hear someone get up, go the bathroom, and knock over a bottle of pills.  It's C.  He comes into the parent's room after putting the pills back in the bottle and sees that I lie awake.  "What's up?" he says, in his normally jovial tone, crooked grin on his face, holding the same plastic cup of water that I had held earlier.

"Did you take your pills last night?" I ask, somewhat worried, mildly annoyed.  

Shrug.

Again, more seriously, "DID you forget to take your pills last night?"

Shrug.  "I dunno."

"Did you know you had a seizure?"

"I <em>did</em>?"  Incredulous.  Doubting.

"Yes, you did," I affirm.  "We were all standing around your bed, looking at you."

"You were?"  C looks over into his room, as though that would help him remember.  "Really?"

"Yes.  So the first thing I want you to do when you wake up in the morning is take your pills, okay?"

"Okay."

I wake up after about 4.5 hours of sleep, and slowly climb out of bed and out of the sleeping bag.  I put on my trusted hoodie and walk down the hallway.  C finds me, ever so certain of himself, and exclaims, "I took my pills at 9 o'clock last night!"

"What?" I spit out.  "You had a seizure!"

Guess what, folks.

"Sabrina, the pills don't <em>keep</em> me from getting seizures, they just keep me from getting <em>bad </em>ones!"

Um, okay.  Great.  Dandy.  Capital.  

So I should expect that at any night, I will be awakened by C having seizures in his sleep, because his medication doesn't prevent them.  Not desirous, at all.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I tread the rocky and uneven pathway, my eyes behold nothing but dirt.  Grey dirt, brown dirt, pebbley dirt, sand, and everything in between.  You can call it dismal.  Everything is grey and yet colorless at the same time.  I have all but forgotten about color.  As I travel across the ground beneath my feet, I stumble over rocks strewn sporadically across the path.
<p>
I continue to walk along the ragged path, accustomed to the dark shadows after what has seemed to be an infinite journey, and notice something extraordinarily bright.  A bright, vertical line.  It expands as it travels through the air and hits the ground.  I take my eyes and allow them to follow the origin of this bright, shining line.  When my eyes reach that origin and my head is tilted toward my back at an excruciating angle, I can no longer look and have to shield eyes with hand so that the brightness is dimmed, but still apparent.</p><p>
What is that? I wonder.  It’s so foreign.  I peek through my hand-shield, between the cracks that are the spaces between my fingers.  That bright ball is expanding, more lines shining around it, and the clouds are cracking to make room.  Some of the clouds look more light, more white, and there is a strange color in between in the cracks.  Certainly not grey.  Far from it, in fact.</p><p>
I believe the shining ball is what they call sun, and the strange color must be the new sky.  Blue?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In other words, a break from my deep thinking.

I got to thinking (ha!), that maybe a few readers would like some light stuff, some stuff that is actual literal in content, instead of imagery and metaphors.  Such a concept, I know.  I also must apologize, because I have found myself to be hypocritical in the blogging etiquette department, in that I have demanded (in my mind, but it still counts), at least two or three blog entries per week from each blogger on my blogroll, yet I can only seem to conjure up something every two to three weeks.  Woe to me.

So, within this series of "a break from deep waters", I will attempt to blog on <b>things that I like</b>.  That will consequently give you a peek into my life, so beware!

I will definitely blog on food and books, because they are most essential to life, besides God, of course (how could you even think anything else!  I am ashamed).  I will also attempt to explain the blogs on my blogroll, but I have another idea.

Drum roll, please.

If you are one of the four people (taking a stab in the dark with this number, because I really have no clue, but you know who you are) who regularly peruse my blog (even if you never comment...now is the time!), perhaps you might <b>suggest a topic or two from my "i am" page</b> (any topic which you see there, because, presumably, I like those things) and I shall grant you your heart's desire with a blog entry on that topic.  The quality of the blog, however, might be for you to determine, haha.  Just kidding on that part.  I will try my very best.

Have at it!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yay!  It's still Tuesday, which means I'm not falling back on my promise to update you all with a blogging agenda "tomorrow" (as I said yesterday, if you noticed).  Many thanks to those of you who contributed to my request for...reader's requests.  It's never too late if you wish to participate (rhyming without thinking...yeah!).  See my previous blog entry <a href="http://pensamientosconfusos.wordpress.com/2009/03/05/a-break-from-deep-waters-introduction/">here</a>.

You have chosen these topics from my "i am" page, and I will blog on them.  I do not know yet in which order they will go:
-"still searching"  (I'm guessing those of you who are curious about this one will get a clearer picture with my thoughts on it.)
-veganism, and as a consequence...
-...food.  Recipes and such.
-books (current reads; brief reviews)
-irony (good one!)
-my missionary aspirations
-emerging/emergent church

...and there you have it!  I should have an entry done by the end of this week.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>i&#039;m a vegan...sort of.  </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The word “vegan” is often misused and misconstrued, so I probably have no idea what that word means to you.  (And my word processor didn’t even know the word.  Sheesh.)<p>
Admittedly, I am being tricky and somewhat deceptive when I use the word "vegan", because I’m presuming (even though I really do not know) that you see it as someone who doesn’t consume fish, meat, dairy or egg products.  This is the most commonly misconstrued view, but  it’s me, in a nutshell.  And <i>vegan</i> is a nice, little, convenient, descriptive word to use in a pinch.</p><p>

What it REALLY means, though, is someone who abstains from animal products COMPLETELY.  They do not consume it, use it, or wear it if it has come from any animal, bugs included, but there is a debate over whether an insect is an animal or not, though...go figure.</p><p>
I guess that means I’m not really a vegan.</p><p>
What am I, then?</p><p>
I suppose the technical term would be <i> strict vegetarian</i>, or maybe even <i>dietary vegan</i>.  I still consume honey occasionally, and I own a wool hat, and (gasp!) leather shoes (I hate the smell of new leather, by the way).  I assure you I didn’t know they were leather before I purchased them, if that helps soothe the sting.  I was all too hasty in making that particular purchase.  Anyhow, I digress.</p><p>
If you decide to forgive me, kind reader, for my deception, then we can proceed, because you are probably now asking, “why?  why are you a strict vegetarian/vegan kind of person?”</p><p>
Two main reasons: <strong> well-being</strong> and <strong>stewardship</strong>.  I guess you could say that well-being is wrapped up in stewardship, but you’ll see why I have separated them.  In the meantime, prepare for a story.</p><p>
I have never been a hugely carnivorous.  My mom said that I loved my fruits and veggies as a kid.  Later on in life, I discovered that dairy products didn’t treat me very well, so I cut them out of my diet.  As a high school student, I went through periods of abstinence from meat.  As a college student, I discovered that it was cheaper not to buy meat, especially the organic, free-range meat that I preferred, after discovering all the added crap that’s in the standard meat.  Besides, I hated, have always hated, handling raw meat, in any way, shape or form.  Disgusting.  Thus, I would eat meat only if I knew where it came from, and if someone else cooked it for me.  That wasn’t very often.</p><p>
Pretty soon, I figured, why pursue the meat thing?  Whenever I actually took the time to chew meat, I noticed how I did not like the flavor at all, and I hated spitting out pieces of fat and bone.  So, I gave up meat altogether, and it’s been a year since I made that decision.  No dairy, no meat.  Shortly thereafter, I gave up eggs, as well, because, as it was with meat, I didn’t really dig the flavor, just the flavor that was added.</p><p>
And I noticed how physically awesome I felt.  Really, I just felt good.  This is where the “well-being” comes in.  And because I felt so good on the inside, it felt pleasant mentally, knowing that I could survive mostly on a plant-based diet, which is very healthy (and yummy, too!).</p><p>

Before I move on to the issue of stewardship, allow me to first make a couple other issues clear:</p><p>
1)  I am not an animal rights activist.  I think that those who elevate animal life above human life have serious double-standards.  There should be a balance.
2)   I am not a “hard-core” environmentalist.  Again, let’s be careful not to elevate nature above God.  The plant earth is the way it is because of sin, yet at the same time, we are caretakers.  Balance!</p><p>
Moving on.  Obviously, good stewardship is required with everything entrusted to us, including the body.  When you eat well, you exercise good stewardship.  No brainer there.  A few months after I was into the vegetarian thing full-swing, I learned a couple other things:</p><p>
1)  How uncomfortable I was with most of the meat industry.  I have no problem with people who treat their animals well and then kill them for meat.  I suppose happy meat tastes better.  The problem is when people become greedy for money, and they start to cut corners - injecting hormones and steroids and what-not, cutting off beaks, and letting the animals live in nasty conditions.  I like animals (and as I said, I’m not an animals rights activist), so I care a little about how they are treated.
</p><p>
You may ask, “Okay, so you care about the meat/animal industry.  What about all that stuff made in China (which is almost everything, it seems)?  The sweat factories?  Child labor?”  Yes,  I do care about that stuff.  Recall what I said about balance?  As much as I am able,  I try to make good choices all-around, and attempt to stay informed.</p><p>
2)  Vegetarianism is more economical, more “green”, if you want to use that term.  They say it's cheaper to grow and harvest plants than it is to raise animals for meat (makes sense to me, at least).  It’s been said that if more people cut back on meat (even just somewhat), there would be more resources to go around. (Although, for Americans, I think we just need to stop eating so much, period.)</p><p>

So, there you have it.  The what and the why of my vegetarianism (or veganism, if  it paints a better picture for you).  Next time I will address the “how” of strict vegetarianism.  Meanwhile, feel free to ask questions.  I don't hate you if you're not a vegetarian. :)  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Within you will find out the "how" of my veganish lifestyle (better late than never, eh?), and some recipes as I experiment.

I love food!

EDIT 9 Feburary 2013 ***this page has disappeared due to bogging restructure.  I haven't forgotten, though, and will attempt to collect the recipes I had previously posted on this page.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft" src="http://subbooks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/pevear_karenina.jpg" alt="" width="318" height="475" />...is like savoring a quality piece of literature, such as <em>Anna Karenina</em>.  As you chocolate lovers know, one cannot rush through a piece of dark chocolate, otherwise you miss the fullness of the texture and the flavor(s).  You must let it melt in your mouth.  It is the same with this book, which Tolstoy named his first novel.   I highly recommend this marvelous literary work, even if you are not going to read anything else Tolstoy has written (quite a bold statement on my part, because I have not read any of his other works).  The plot is very well developed, the characters are rich, and the moral dilemmas which Tolstoy addresses are timeless.   Since <em>Anna Karenina </em>is about 800 pages, I would indeed recommend savoring it.  It is well worth your time.

***EDIT***  I usually don't give full-blown synopses of books I'm reading unless I am addressing critical issues (in this case, there would be the numerous moral questions, as well as literary criticism) in it as well.  I will recommend a book, and leave it up to you to look up.  But here's a very succinct glimpse of the book to whet your appetite:  <em>a peek into the lives of 19th century Russian socialites and those who surround them.</em>

By the way, I compare mediocre literature to milk chocolate.  Too many added fillers, and not enough substance.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I thought I'd put in a plug for some cool blogs on my blogroll.  If you are on my blogroll and don't see yourself on this list, it's not because I am a blog racist, it's because I have already put in a plug for you, or will highlight your blog...next time!  Unless you'd rather not, I suppose.  Shoot me an email if you'd have a problem with that.

But for now:

<a href="http://adventuresinthearchetypes.blogspot.com/2009/04/am-i-rational.html">Am I Rational?</a> A cool new blog centered on theology and apologetics,<em> Adventures in the Archetypes</em>, asks if it is indeed rational to trust a trustworthy person.  Collie Coburn, a recent graduate from Wheaton (M.A., Historical and Systematic Theology), and Danny Marriott (graduate of San Diego Christian) contribute.

Nate Duriga, who is almost done at <a href="http://www.nbs.edu">Northwest Baptist Seminary</a> (I think) puts in a plug for us Bible nerds, as well as some pitfalls to having a seminary education at <a href="http://confusionatahigherlevel.blogspot.com">Impoverished Sage</a>.

I think my friend Brenda would like some interaction in this interesting discussion, <a href="http://kwihee.wordpress.com/2009/04/18/to-initiate-or-not-to-initiate-that-is-the-question/">"To Initiate or Not to Initiate?  That is the Question."</a>

Matt Richey, another student (and graduate) of NBS, always likes to interact with and test traditionally held beliefs, and almost always has something thoughtful and articulate to share at <a href="http://faithforgedindoubt.blogspot.com/">Faith Forged in the Furnace of Doubt</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p style="line-height:19px;font:12px Palatino;margin:0 0 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">I would rather be a missionary overseas more than anything else.  </span></p>
<p style="line-height:19px;font:12px Palatino;margin:0 0 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">I really do not have a preference as to what I end up doing as a missionary, I guess I just have to choose a “niche” and a location.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:19px;font:12px Palatino;margin:0 0 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">Perhaps I am not searching.  Maybe I am procrastinating.  Perhaps the answer is right in front of me, and I have yet to rub the sleep out of eyes to gain a clear focus.  Excuses for my lack of quick-decision-making skills.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:19px;font:12px Palatino;margin:0 0 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">After all, it is not rare for me to use half an hour in determining which flavor of soy /rice/coconut milk ice cream I want.                        </span></p>

I kinda like it, and kinda don't.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<sup>"</sup>Do everything without complaining or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe"

~Philippians 2.14-15

I generally pride myself (yeah, I know), on being able to stifle my complaints.  Problem is, it's not about what <em>I </em>can do, and I am sorely reminded of this as I watch the outside temperature climb.

Summer heat makes for a very grumpy me.  I wake up grumpy, even go to bed grumpy sometimes, and try as I might to stop them, I have complaints going through my head 24/7, mostly trying to blame other people for the way I feel.  I also blame the heat (at the moment, I'm thinking, "<em>WHY</em> did Mom put hot soup on the menu?  It's a freaking 100 degrees outside!!!").  But according to the passage above, this is not acceptable.  Not. At. All.  No exceptions.

See, if I tried all by myself to be blameless and perfect, I could certainly, indubitably pride myself on not complaining, since I alone am putting in all the effort; however, I'm not.  If not for Christ, I could not do any of that at all.  That's what the whole of Philippians 2 is about, but here are verses 12 and 13, to add to the context.  (Also, think about the Philippians.  They were poor, very poor, and worried about Paul because he was in prison.  Very good reasons to complain, if you ask me.)

<sup>"</sup>Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose."

It's God.  It's not just me.  Summer heat or not, I still have to work on being blameless and pure, because it's God who works through me.  I cannot, and should not complain, because God has lavished his blessings on me, first and foremost through salvation.

In fact, I guess I should be thankful for the summer heat, because as a thorn in my side, it reminds me I can do nothing by my own strength.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I wasn't originally going to post this, but it appears that many are still interested in the subject.   I originally wrote this because I am applying to be a mentor in a conservative youth mime/drama troupe (they are, at this time, under an umbrella that upholds courtship as the only way to go), and they require a statement on courtship versus dating.  So, without further ado, I present my statement/letter.
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">When I was younger (in high school, early college years), my parents did not want me to date.  Rather, they chose to embrace the idea of courtship, which they never got a chance to use very well, because no one legitimately expressed interest in me.  I have read I Kissed Dating Goodbye, Waiting for Her Isaac, Boy Meets Girl,  When God Writes Your Love Story, and countless other books on courtship.  I am now on my late twenties, have lived on my own, have gone out on dates, and have come to realize that courtship is not for everyone.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">“Courtship” is the general process whereby a man pursues a woman.  Method is not important, as a man who is “dating” a woman could easily say “I am courting _______.”  Back before women gained more independence (early 20th century and before), courtship was used in a broad and specific sense because a man would court a girl at home under the supervision of parents, and “dating” had not yet arrived on the scene.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">The term “courtship” has been more recently associated (mostly in the home school circles) with an alternative to “dating”  as a throwback to the old-fashioned way of doing things, per se.  Usually, when a guy is interested in a girl, he would speak to her father.  If the father approved, then the guy would be given permission to visit the girl at home, in the company of her family.  Restrictions vary from family to family, but the main goal is to “court” with the ultimate intention/goal of marriage, under the strict guidance of the parents, as opposed to “dating”, which does not usually involve the parents as much, and does not often have the goal of marriage.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">Courtship (from hereon as defined in the second paragraph), is very often  purported  to be the “biblical alternative” to dating, implying that dating is not biblical, but that idea has been sorely misconstrued.  First, courtship is found nowhere in the Bible.  Anyone who knows the Scriptures well knows that couples were married by betrothal.  Secondly, it is not guaranteed that every courtship will end in marriage.  The purpose of courtship is to seriously consider the possibility of marriage; to guarantee a marriage would be to utilize the method of betrothal.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">Dating (and here I am referring to a case in which a girl gets asked out by a guy, without going through her father)  has a different approach  than courtship, but, for the most part, serves the same purpose.  Most people in their twenties and beyond who are looking for a serious relationship leading to marriage will use dating as their approach.  And again, as with courtship, it is not guaranteed to end in marriage.</div>

<div><em>When I was younger (in high school, early college years), my parents did not want me to date.  Rather, they chose to embrace the idea of courtship, which they never got a chance to use very well, because no one legitimately expressed interest in me.  I have read </em>I Kissed Dating Goodbye, Waiting for Her Isaac, Boy Meets Girl,  When God Writes Your Love Story,<em> and countless other books on courtship.  I am now on my late twenties, have lived on my own, have gone out on dates, and have come to realize that courtship is not for everyone.</em></div>
<div><em>
</em></div>
<div><em>“Courtship” is the general process whereby a man pursues a woman.  Method is not important, as a man who is “dating” a woman could easily say “I am courting _______.”  Back before women gained more independence (early 20th century and before), courtship was used in a broad and specific sense because a man would court a girl at home under the supervision of parents, and “dating” had not yet arrived on the scene.</em></div>
<div><em>
</em></div>
<div><em>The term “courtship” has been more recently associated (mostly in the home school circles) with an alternative to “dating”  as a throwback to the old-fashioned way of doing things, per se.  Usually, when a guy is interested in a girl, he would speak to her father.  If the father approved, then the guy would be given permission to visit the girl at home, in the company of her family.  Restrictions vary from family to family, but the main goal is to “court” with the ultimate intention/goal of marriage, under the strict guidance of the parents, as opposed to “dating”, which does not usually involve the parents as much, and does not often have the goal of marriage.</em></div>
<div><em>
</em></div>
<div><em>Courtship (from hereon as defined in the second paragraph), is very often  purported  to be the “biblical alternative” to dating, implying that dating is not biblical, but that idea has been sorely misconstrued.  First, courtship is found nowhere in the Bible.  Anyone who knows the Scriptures well knows that couples were married by betrothal.  Secondly, it is not guaranteed that every courtship will end in marriage.  The purpose of courtship is to seriously consider the possibility of marriage; to guarantee a marriage would be to utilize the method of betrothal. </em></div>
<div><em>
</em></div>
<div><em>Dating (and here I am referring to a case in which a girl gets asked out by a guy, without going through her father)  has a different approach  than courtship, but, for the most part, serves the same purpose.  Most people in their twenties and beyond who are looking for a serious relationship leading to marriage will use dating as their approach.  And again, as with courtship, it is not guaranteed to end in marriage.</em></div>
<div><em>
</em></div>
<div><em>Based on the above, I do not believe courtship is superior to or more biblical than dating.  They both serve the same purpose, and marriage cannot be guaranteed by either one.  For the Christian who wants to please God, s/he will date or court for God’s glory, and will seek wisdom no matter which method they choose to use.  To say that courtship is more biblical than dating is a fallacy.</em></div>
<div><em>
</em></div>
<div><em>I do not recommend courtship as the only way to go for everyone.   For the girl or guy who is still in high school, still living at home, I certainly do not recommend one-on-one dating.  For the woman who has established a singular identity, no longer living at home with her parents, dating would be more convenient.  In both scenarios, however,  it would be remiss not to seek wise counsel, and in some instances, I would advise against either approach, because a person must have his/her life right before God before pursuing a relationship with anyone.  In short, I have a tendency to use pragmatism combined with the counsel of God’s word.</em></div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I got officially lost, for the first time, and skipped the first in this season of baby showers as a consequence.

Tried to articulate a book review onto digital paper, and failed (still in the works).

Dealt with fraud and won.

Have developed a loathing for craigslist.

Laughed at doofuses.

Cancelled my e-crapimony account.

Baked &amp; ate too many cookies (chocolate chip; vegan and gluten-free).

Blanked out on some basic chords during Sunday's worship service, and realized that I really do depend on green tea every a.m.

Took a break from computers for over 50 hours, and now find facebook and email to be quite tiring.

And I miss my MacBook.  Very much.

How was your memorial weekend?]]></content:encoded>

				<title>the (infamous) shack, by william p. young</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's a bit of a warning (or apology) to you readers.  I know some of you like to read detail upon detail in book reviews, but in this one, I'm going to disappoint you.  And I really don't care that much.

"Why?"  you ask.  "That's meanish."    Well, because:

1) I borrowed the book from the library, and had to return it before I was through analyzing all the pages I had marked, which numbered quite a few.

2) There are a gazillion other views on <em>The Shack, <span style="font-style:normal;">and I</span></em> can point to you to one of the more detailed reviews <a href="http://faithforgedindoubt.blogspot.com/2008/12/book-review-shack.html">here</a>.  You can go there after you've finished reading through my spiel and tell me whether I'm right or wrong.  ;-)

Because I did not have a chance to scour the book as well as I would've liked, I'm going to make this simple.  I will attempt to answer the question, <em>should I read </em>The Shack<em>?</em>

The answer:  yes, and/or no.  Ha!  I said it would be simple, didn't I?  Don't worry; it still is, compared to many other reviews, and the above link being one of them.

<em>Here's why I say "yes".</em>

1)  I enjoyed reading <em>The Shack</em>, for what it was.  I was actually surprised at the decent literary quality - it's much better than most of what contemporary Christian fiction (CCF) has to offer.  The plot was clearly laid out, the characters well developed, and descriptions vivid.  Most of the book was dialogue, but I don't think that discredits its literary quality in any way.  If you don't like to read CCF because of its mediocre to poor literary quality, you would probably be pleasantly surprised with this book.  For those of you who are not familiar with <em>The Shack </em>or<em> </em>have not read it, here's a summary.

<em>Mack is middle-aged, and lives the pretty average life for a married guy with a family, except for one thing - The Great Sadness.  He’s been living with this ever since his six year old daughter, Missy, was abducted and murdered during a family camping trip. They never find the body; instead, they found her blood-stained dress, in a run down shack, in the middle of the forest wilderness.  One cold winter day, Mack receives a note in his mailbox, an invitation from “Papa” to come to the shack, the very same one where Missy‘s dress was found.  Not without doubts and speculations, Mack goes to the shack, and encounters the triune God (in the form of Papa, a robust African-American grandmother figure [God the Father], Jesus, a Middle Eastern carpenter [who‘d a thunk?], and Sarayu, a dainty Asian woman [the Holy Spirit]), with whom he spends the weekend, mostly in dialogue and learning.</em>

2)   I know this is going to sound cliche, but it's a huge element/theme running throughout the book:  I liked <em>The Shack</em> because of its poignant emphasis on relationship with God.  Yeah, it's Christianese talk to speak of one's relationship with God, but, really, how often do we remember and behave as though God is <em>actually our Father</em>?  Think about it, really think.  I know I'm guilty of forgetting that relationship thing, although it's very easy to talk about, right?

<em>Here's why I might say "no".</em>

<em><span style="font-style:normal;"><em>Da Vinci Code </em>has something in common with<em> The Shack</em>, believe it or not.</span></em>

a) They both received some not-so-nice reviews.  Actually, make that <em><strong>scathing</strong></em> reviews.

b)  They are both fiction, spun in such a way as to draw in the unwitting reader while feeding them both stories and truth mixed up really well.

I think <em>The Shack</em>'s most severe critics often forget that it's fiction, and that it has very little to no potential in being used as a seminary textbook.  That being said, <em>The Shack </em>is chockfull of Theology Proper (Young went to seminary, so is it really a surprise?), and it would be wise to put on your thinking cap as you read this.  Don't check your theological brains out at the door, because there are some issues presented to think through regarding Trinitarian theology, as well as the sovereignty of God, and that's just a simplified generalization.

I would probably be very cautious in recommending this book to a "baby Christian" - someone who has not had a lot of solid Biblical teaching - but, I might give it to someone in order to use it as a springboard into discussions regarding Theology Proper.

~

Alrighty, those are my thoughts on that bestseller.  I also have a question:  is it possible to over- emphasize the "relationship with God" aspect of Christianity?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I will be the first to say I'm not a girly girl, even though I may look like one.  Here are some tip-offs:

1) I don't like to shop.  That's practically female treason.  Well, I like to shop for books - that's a given.  What kind of nerd would I be if I didn't like to peruse bookshops?
2) I own only a few pieces of clothing that have feminine prints (i.e., flowers or lacy things) on them, and I hardly ever wear them.
3) Facebook said I was 0% girly.  Okay, maybe that's slightly fallacious (very fallacious) quiz, but still.
4) I detest wearing heels.  I'm a komplete kween of klutziness when I wear them, and they hurt.
5) I'd rather not carry a purse.  A book bag will suffice, or nothing.  Nothing's good.  Because I usually carry enough to fit in my hands or pockets, or a load of books.
6) I am not a fan of diamonds.  Oy!  Sorry, that was probably harsh sounding to some of your ears.
7) I've only perused <a href="http://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a> one or two times, mainly because a friend had started one up.  And boy oh boy, I was sorely unaware that so many people (probably females) use Etsy, until Sunday.  I guess you're not a girly girl unless you shop Etsy.  ;-)

Sunday afternoon there was hosted a lovely Blogger's Lunch, in the L.A. area, by <a href="http://notesfromdionne.blogspot.com">Dionne</a>.  I think everyone of the girl bloggers (in cluding Dionne and <a href="http://piggyinthepuddle.blogspot.com">Lindsey</a>) has an Etsy page except for me and <a href="http://maggisaar.blogspot.com">Maggi</a>, who is considering setting one up because she makes these fab purses, and <a href="http://bethanymurphy.net/">Bethany</a> (okay, so that's only half of the us female bloggers...I guess Etsy is kinda overwhelming ;-) ).  And not only that, but each of the girl bloggers got a little gift basket chockfull of gifts from insanely creative Etsy sponsors, <a href="http://ohhellofriend.blogspot.com">Danni</a> one of them.  There were many squeals and exclamations of gratitude and delight at the discovery of the little things within that basket.  I have to admit, the stuff is cute, and I do like wearing earrings and rings, which everyone scored in their baskets.  Oh, and Danni also won the door prize, which <em>also</em> produced delighted squeals.   I get tired of squealing and exclaiming so much, so you didn't hear any squeals from me.  Fortunately, none of the guys like <a href="http://pasadenawhereyouat.blogspot.com">Eric </a>or <a href="http://trendell.blogspot.com">Andrew</a> or <a href="http://circumstances4clappinghands.blogspot.com">Jon</a> (who just got a blog yesterday) or Evan or Nick were squealing or exclaiming, so I was in good company.

I'm not going to summarize the Bloggers' Luncheon on here, because Maggi, Lindsey, and Dionne all have nice summaries and sweet (and silly) photos on their blogs.  Check 'em out, and check out some of the cool Etsy shops, if you're into that.  I will probably explore Etsy a bit more when I secure a real job.

Thanks to Dionne for helping me connect with my girly side.  I think there is one on me, somewhere.]]></content:encoded>

<p style="font:12px Handwriting;min-height:16px;margin:0;"><span style="color:#003366;">...when I think "emerging"  or "emergent" church)</span></p>
<p style="font:14px Arial;min-height:16px;margin:0;"></p>
<p style="font:14px Century Gothic;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">Many people simply classify the emerging (or emergent) church as those who were unhappy with their previous traditional churches, gathering around to complain about the state of the more fundamental church.  It sure seems that way many times, and many times that is true, but sometimes it is not.  Some genuinely want to contextualize (speaking the language of the immediate context/culture)  the gospel to reach those otherwise not reached by the good news, while still upholding scriptural truths (this would be more descriptive of the emerging church), while some want to go beyond that and become more inclusive of the different denominations/sects of Christianity (including Orthodoxy and Catholicism - this would be more descriptive of the “emergent” church).  From now on in this post, I will use "emerging" and "emergent" differently, in accordance with those descriptions.</span></p>
<p style="font:14px Palatino;min-height:16px;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;"> </span></p>
<p style="font:14px Century Gothic;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">What first drew me into the emerging church was the whole “missional” aspect.  I liked the idea that the church body spent intentionally spent time within the community to reach the people of the community, and were constantly donating their time, effort, finances, and talent to reach the needy (spiritually, physically, emotionally needy), essentially “doing missions” locally, as well as internationally.  This was in contrast to a church I had attended for most of my life (at the time), which was constantly seeking to draw people into the church, instead of being the hands and feet of Christ to those outside the church.</span></p>
<p style="font:14px Palatino;min-height:16px;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;"> </span></p>
<p style="font:14px Century Gothic;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">Another thing that drew me in was the appreciation for the arts.  I had grown tired of people in the church settling for mediocre sound and visuals, just because it had a “Christian” label.  And not only that, but this emerging church had its own artists and musicians who shared their work with everyone else in the body.</span></p>
<p style="font:14px Palatino;min-height:16px;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;"> </span></p>
<p style="font:14px Century Gothic;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">Of course, I liked the candles and the ambiance on Sunday mornings, the emphasis on sharing meals together and all that.  Always a plus in my book.  Plus, I enjoyed hanging around people who asked questions, were not afraid of drinking a bit of wine or beer, and generally looked cool.  Perhaps not the best of motives, but let’s call it icing on the cake, shall we?</span></p>
<p style="font:14px Palatino;min-height:16px;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;"> </span></p>
<p style="font:14px Century Gothic;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">Emerging churches are basically known for the above, whilst, for the most part, remaining pretty orthodox in doctrine (Reformed, Baptist).  Mars Hill Church, founded by Mark Driscoll, is doctrinally sound while still remaining culturally relevant in its immediate context (to a point...see my thoughts toward the end).  There are even churches that fall in the “in between” category of emerging/emergent.  Pastor Mark has a nifty little <em><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58fgkfS6E-0">video</a></strong></em> to help explain it better than I can.</span></p>
<p style="font:14px Palatino;min-height:16px;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;"> </span></p>
<p style="font:14px Century Gothic;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">The emergent churches are similar, but their doctrine is more liberal, they are more “post-modern” in feel, have a loathing for anything systematic, and they tend to be more pluralistic and extremely integrative.  Brian McLaren’s book <em>A Generous Orthodoxy</em> would help you understand that a little better (you may come away from that book more confused...ha!).  The long subtitle reads: <em>Why I am a missional + evangelical + post/protestant + liberal/conservative + mystical/poetic + biblical + charismatic/contemplative + fundamentliast/calvinist + anabaptist/anglican + methodist + catholic + green + incarnational + depressed-yet-hopeful + emergent + unfinished Christian. </em>Mark Driscoll used to be part of The Emergent Village (McLaren is one of the founders, I believe, or even the main founder), but then later chose not to associate himself with them, as they begun to stray away from essential foundational doctrine (such as the inspiration of scripture, and the sovereignty of God). </span></p>
<p style="font:14px Palatino;min-height:16px;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;"> </span></p>
<p style="font:14px Century Gothic;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">Just for the record, I see nothing wrong with diminishing the number of labels people tend to use, and I think that’s one of McLaren’s main goals.  He probably wouldn’t advocate the usage of the emergent/emerging labels.  But once you get to the nitty gritty of essential doctrinal differences, it’s simply impossible to combine them all and have a happy, universal church faithful to scripture.  It’s dangerous to think that Baptists can be Catholics, too.  Mark Driscoll used to be part of The Emergent Village (McLaren is one of the founders, I believe, or even the main founder), but then later chose not to associate himself with them, as they begun to stray away from essential foundational doctrine (such as the inspiration of scripture, and the sovereignty of God). </span></p>
<p style="font:14px Palatino;min-height:16px;margin:0;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span></p>
<p style="font:14px Century Gothic;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">So, some closing thoughts.  I don’t thing anything is wrong with contextualization in general.  I’m all for the missional and contextual and the community aspects of the emerging church, but it’s often too easy overemphasize contextualization and use it as an excuse to participate in cultural activities that would be contrary to scripture, or as an excuse not to pursue holiness.  Discernment is always in order, yes?  It’s also interesting that the word “missional” has just recently (within the past ten years or so) become a buzzword among the Christian circle.  Shouldn’t all Christians strive to be “missional”?  And what about the community thing?  Shouldn’t all believers seek community?  We are family, after all.</span></p>
<p style="font:14px Palatino;min-height:16px;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;"> </span></p>
<p style="font:14px Century Gothic;margin:0;"><span style="letter-spacing:0;">There you go, curious friends.  That’s my take on the ol’ trend.  I’m by no means an expert, so feel free to add your thoughts if you think mine incomplete, and please watch Pastor Mark’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58fgkfS6E-0">video on the different streams of the emerging church</a> - it’s quite helpful and concise.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I usually don't make strong political statements, because I dislike stirring up debate.   Even so, this is not considered a "strong political statement", but I needed to get some stuff off my chest.  And this is not directed at anyone in particular, so please do not feel that I am targeting you.

People, please...

Are right-wing, conservative, Republican politics really the gospel?  I've yet to see someone effectively evangelized or converted by the forcing of right-wing politics down their throat, especially when the arguments are primarily ad hominem.

Change begins on the inside, and works its way out.  The reverse is not true.

Also, please do not think that just because I am a "Christian", it means I am a Republican, or should be a Republican.  I do not wish to adopt political parties mindlessly, simply because it is the trend amongst those with beliefs similar to mine.  I do not think that the GOP is the elect political party.

Okay, the end (I hope).]]></content:encoded>

Speaking of omens, you should read <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(novel)">The Alchemist </a></em>(Paulo Coelho) for an interesting tale of destiny, fate, and omens.  It's short, and if you like a good philosophical novel, you will not be disappointed.  There are some things to ponder, and some other things that are simply not true, but, hey, it's a novel.  Whaddya expect?  It's an enjoyable read, so go read it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I read Donald Miller's description of a writer in <em>Blue Like Jazz </em>(I must read this book once a year)<em>, </em>and had to laugh, because I definitely saw myself somewhere within the description:

(p 187)
<blockquote><em>Writers don't make any money at all.  We make about a dollar.  It is terrible.  But then again we don't work either.  We sit around in our underwear until noon then go downstairs and make coffee, fry some eggs, read the paper, read part of a book, smell the book, wonder if perhaps we ourselves should work on our book, smell the book again, throw the book across the room because we are quite jealous that any other person wrote a book, feel terribly guilty about throwing the schmuck's book across the room because we secretly wonder if God in heaven noticed our evil jealousy, or worse, our laziness.  We then lie across the couch facedown and mumble to God to forgive us because we are secretly afraid He is going to dry up all our words because we envied another man's stupid words.  And for this, as I said before, we are paid a dollar.</em></blockquote>
Except, I'm not a writer.  I'm a pretend writer.  A baby writer, at best.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[...is God, and I am not.

I think that's a phrase from a popular Christian song (Steven Curtis Chapman, if I'm not mistaken, but you'll have to forgive me if I'm wrong, because I don't really listen to whole lot of "Christian" music), and people say it all the time.  But do they really know what they mean when they say that?  God is God.  You are not.  I am not.  God does what he pleases, how he pleases, when he pleases and it never fails.  It's all over the Bible, friends (Psalm 115, Isaiah 64 are some OT examples) .  It's something I cannot do, and it's something no one can do.

It's really easy to say that God is in control, right?  It's another thing to take it heart and live as though it were really true (which it is), but even I still behave and sometimes think as though I am the goddess of my own little world, and then my soul cries and throws a temper tantrum at God (sometimes this shows up on the surface, and when that happens, I just go and lock myself in my room, because no one wants to see me throw a tantrum) when things do not go as I planned them. (I am the queen of plans.  I plan things perfectly, of course.  Correct?  Bzzzzt.  Wrong.)  Because, deep down, God's sovereignty hasn't really sunk in.

And then I ask the question,

What if our souls actually soaked up the fact of God's sovereignty and lived it out?  What would it look like from day to day?

I have a feeling there would not be so many angry and anxious people.  I think we would spend more time praying (because, honestly people, sometimes praying does not feel productive, and we always have to be doing something to feel like we are controlling our situations), and I think some of us would even take more risks.  I will be thinking about this for awhile, but I want to know what you think, too.  I can't be the only around here who thinks about this.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>tid bits in the midst of summer heat</title>
		<link>http://sabri.na:8888/tid-bits-in-the-midst-of-summer-heat/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The summer heat is seriously sucking out my brain juice.  All I want to do is curl up into a ball and take a nap in the refrigerator.  I know, bad idea, but with humidity and highs of between 105 and 110, I'm desperate.  Especially with the AC unit broken.

I was reflecting upon the days when I first discovered writing, and remembered that all I wrote was fiction.  Childish fiction (since I was a child), but fiction nonetheless.  I'm going to try my hand at it again and see what comes of it.  Probably won't see it on here, though.

And, I've decided not to talk/write about what I'm going to write, because it seems to spoil the writing.  If you were superstitious, you would probably say my writing becomes jinxed once I blab about it.

If you use blogger, you may not know this, but with wordpress, I can see daily blog stats, and I know someone (or many someones)  is reading my blog.  I don't know <em>who </em>you are, but I see from whence you have come, if you happen to click a link to my blog from another source.  And that is how I know there is this anonymous person who has been accessing my blog from another friend's blog <a href="http://kwihee.wordpress.com">(two cent thoughts)</a> numerous times a day (sometimes looking at 10-20 of my posts daily).  There has also been an anonymous person clicking on my twitter feed (to your right) multiple times a day (coincidentally, on the same days when my blog is accessed through two cent thoughts).  I'm inclined to believe they are the same person, but they haven't commented on any of my posts (even after looking at between 10-20 of them).  Now, I'm not scared that someone is stalking me.  That's not the reason for this blurb.  I'm just curious what your name is.  What if we're friends?  Please speak up.  If you're shy and prefer not to say anything, that's okay, but I'm afraid curiosity will slay me in the end.  If I had a more popular blog, I probably wouldn't even be writing this, but because my blog is so little and of so little consequence (and I like to be friends with the people who read it), I'd like to know who is so utterly fascinated with my blog and my twitter updates.  That's all.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a thing for metaphors.

After I had quite the nerdy discussion with someone about similes versus metaphors, I got to thinking about why I like metaphors so much (yes, RB, those include similes ;)).

Here's what I came up with.

1) We use them everyday, and don't even realize it.

2) Because the imagery provoked by the metaphor communicates much better than just a sentence with adjectives, a sentence interpreted according to literal definitions and syntax, and I'm a visual person. (You could say that all words have their connotations and thus provoke a certain imagery, but I'm speaking of pictures.  You know what I mean...a picture paints a thousand words, right?)  This is the main reason I use metaphors in poetry so often.

3) They make me think, and if you know me well, you know I like to think.  A lot.

The <strong>problem</strong> with metaphors, though, especially with many literary pieces (and this is why I scored higher in the math section of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBEST">CBEST</a> than on the reading section...stupid multiple possible interpretations!), is that they sometimes contain <em>so many </em>different possible interpretations, one could spend <em>years </em>debating.  But guess what?  Most likely (meaning, there are exceptions), you will never know the real meaning and intent of the metaphor unless you are the author of said metaphor.

So, the very thing I love about metaphors is the very thing that sometimes annoys the crap out of me.  What gives?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nothing really new or novel, that is.  Sorry to disappoint you, friends.

I've been housesitting this week, so it's just me with two dogs and two birds.  I talk to them, because there is no one else with whom to carry on conversations, even though I'm doing all the talking. 

And then it dawned on me - I do not think I am the loner I sometimes claim to be.  I might be okay with being a loner for one or two days, but after that, it's not good.  I crave interaction, even though I'm predominantly an introvert (which means I must work at expressing myself verbally), and I watch television so I can hear other voices.  And after a couple more days of not interacting with anyone else, I easily fall into a hermit style of living, which keeps me inside the house (and reluctant to be social).  I could fall, dead, on the floor, and no one would notice, except for the dogs.  Sad.

I think what Jack on LOST said is true; if we don't live together, we'll die alone.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Friend, if you are waiting for God to tell you what to do with your life, chances are you'll be waiting for a long time.  If you're idle <strong><em>and </em><span style="font-weight:normal;">waiting for God to break the silence, well...all I can say is, the book of Proverbs will convict you about that, and you are probably (obviously) missing out on many present opportunities.</span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">I am not saying that God <em>will never </em>tell you what to do.  God is more creative than every single human being's imagination put together.  He just might.  I am just saying it is not the normal thing.</span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">If you tell me that God "called you" to this profession/occupation, I am going to ask you what you mean by that.  If you say God placed a burden on your heart, okay, fine.  God places a "burden on your heart" for many things.  But many believe in the notion that everyone has a calling, and God will tell them what it is, and how to fulfill it. <em><span style="color:#c0c0c0;"> (By the way, I wrote a little book review dealing with the subject of calling and vocation </span></em><a href="http://pensamientosconfusos.wordpress.com/2006/09/07/vocation/"><em><span style="color:#ff0000;">here</span></em></a><em><span style="color:#c0c0c0;">, so I will try not to repeat what I wrote already.) </span></em></span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">Um, here's something from my closet of secrets: God hasn't told me what to do with my life.   Am I a weirdo because I haven't (supposedly) found my calling?  Is something wrong with me, or, dare I ask, should I even call myself a Christian?</span></strong>

Answers: no, no, and yes.

No doubt, there are many scriptural accounts of people being "called" by God to do great things.  What I mean by that is, God actually spoke to them with a real live voice, be it in a dream, or in a vision, or, just in a conversation.  What I then ask is, what about all the people who were contemporaries of those aforementioned, but not mentioned in the Bible?  They seem to be greater in number than those to whom God gave special revelation/s.  Surely there are many godly people not mentioned, and we will never know if God spoke to them in a dramatic way, or even in a not-so-dramatic way.  The tendency is to zero in on those portrayed in scripture and say, "Oh, look!  God told Abraham where to go.  He totally floored Paul when He spoke to him on the road to Damascus, and also guided him through dreams and visions!  And look at Jeremiah; God told him his occupation [not a very glamorous one, I dare say]!  That means God will speak to me through rainbows and tell me what to do, because it's normal!"

Newsflash:  that is not the norm.  Chances are very good that you'll never be an Abraham, Paul, Jeremiah, or [throw in someone to whom God spoke in the Bible].

So, my advice to you if you are trying to decide which way to go and what to do: carefully weigh your options with prayer and wise counsel, read Proverbs, and DO IT if wisdom says "yes."  God may or may not speak to you, but He is <em>sure</em> to place you where He sees fit, for your good, and for His glory.  Just don't sit around.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay, so, I know that "Christians" aren't supposed to have "pet peeves", because we're supposedly supposed to have the patience of saints, or whatever.  BUT

I have a pet peeve of the year, if you can call it that.  And since I've no energy to do anything physical and not enough mental energy to do heavy thinking, I might as well do something slightly mental and write something frivolous.   Thus, I will write about my pet peeve of the year, and that is (drum roll, please!)...

Washingtonian driving (no offense to those amongst my friends who might actually drive this way)!

Let me clarify before you start laughing at me.

1) "Washingtonian driving" usually means the majority of people who grew up in WA, and learned how to drive in WA.

2)  I realize there are exceptions.

Having settled all that, let's get cracking.  There are several pet peeves contained within this one pet peeve, and I will illustrate them for you.

<em>Four-way stops. </em>Yes, you all have the "stopping" part down, peoples, and even though this is coming from a Southern Californian, it's true.  You stop.  And stay stopped, wondering, "is it my turn?  Should I go?  Okay, I'll go.  Oh, wait, that person moved, so I'll stop and let them go.  Okay, my turn now? Oh, wait..."  Um, you've heard of right-of-way?  'Cause I use it, and I will go when it's my turn, even though there are two of us going the same way, or one of us is going in the opposite direction (much to your bafflement).

<em>Freeway interchanges. </em>Just because you are changing freeways does not mean you need to slow down to 35 mph.  We're still on a freeway, folks.

<em>Speed limits in dry weather, because they drive as if it's raining all the time</em>.  Hey, did you know that the posted speed limit is not the maximum speed?  In other words, when the speed limit is 50, you can go 55, or even 50.  Please, please, do not go 40 mph.  You're killing me!  And on freeways, it's legit to go <em>65 miles per hour when the speed limit is 60 miles per hour</em>.  Yeah!  Isn't it liberating?

<em>Roundabouts</em>.  LOL.  I love roundabouts, even though I had never encountered them before I moved to Tacoma for the first time.  But the funny thing is, people think they have to stop <em>before </em>they enter the thing.

<em>Four way intersections in which there are no stop signs; only "yield" signs. </em>Are you sure you're not confusing those "yield" signs with "stop" signs?  Maybe "California stops" would come in handy here.

<em>Driving in snow</em>.  Ha, ha.  I won't even go there.

<em>Passing. </em>Yes, it is okay to pass, just so you know.  I will pass if I can (more often than not, however, all four lanes across the freeway are blocked by drivers all. going. the. same. rate).

Okay, those are the main parts of the pet peeve.  I know some of you can relate to my frustration in this matter, so feel free to add to the list.  ;)

To kind of balance out the silliness of this post, I will now kindly point you to a very non-silly and extremely thought-provoking post by a fellow seminary student <a href="http://confusionatahigherlevel.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-wonder-as-i-wander.html"><span style="color:#99cc00;">here</span></a><span style="color:#99cc00;">,</span> on the current state of the church in America (mostly in relation to culture/missions), and what it might look like in the future (post-Christian America?).  I might even take that topic and run with it on here in the near future, if time allows.  Enjoy!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I wonder a lot.  This is just another pondering, and hopefully not too controversial for the lover of peace that I am, coming up with blog ideas when I am supposed to be studying. :)  Oh, and this is also slightly related to Nate's recent blog entry <a href="http://confusionatahigherlevel.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-wonder-as-i-wander.html">here</a>.

Question to ponder...do you think that those who claim Christianity and shun the "secular" (meaning, anything not related to the church, whether it be media [films, music, books, art, etc.], culture, events, people, customs, etc.), staying inside the "sacred" bubble, are partly to blame for the increasingly "post-Christian" America?  And if so, what can be done to remedy that?

To use a not-so-great-but-sufficient illustration, say people never left a Christian bookstore, like Dightman's, because it's supposed to be a safe, relatively moral bubble for everyone.  They stayed because everything in the outside world is dirty and scary.  One brave soul ventures into the outside world, and is utterly shocked to find the rampant ungodliness, wondering how it became that way.  Shocked as shocked can be, she flees back to the Bubble where it is warm and safe, and warns everyone inside not to go outside, otherwise they'll become dirty and scared (and maybe even scarred).

This may be my cynical self coming out again (slightly :) ), but I think about stuff nonetheless, and I don't know that I've come up with a solid answer yet.]]></content:encoded>

I know there aren't many of you who actually read my blog, because my posts are not that Biblically nerdy, but, I know there are a handful of you.

I need help in deciding which Bible software to invest in (in the next year or so).  Now that Logos has a version for Mac, I'm leaning toward them, but I hear that Accordance is also good stuff.  I will be using it mainly for the language tools.

Input invited and appreciated.  :)]]></content:encoded>

Sorry for not updating this thing.  I am stuffing my head full of philosophical and theological concepts, and trying to find my footing in Hebrew and Greek again.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Although I like twitter sometimes, sometimes it is just information overload.  And there's Buzz, and I'm sure many other social media of which I am happily unaware.

I think twitter has been stealing from the creativity that is supposed to go into my blog.  Or rather, overpowering with its information overload.  'Cause, you see, when you're busy attempting to remember 500+ words for Hebrew vocabulary exams, reading hundreds of pages for theology classes, trying to come up with decent exegesis (and then building it into theology, contextualizing it and applying it), checking Facebook, checking email....checking twitter, occasionally reading for pleasure.....

<strong>BAM!!</strong>

Something's going to explode.  I think that would be my brain.  And I think that the explosion would expel all my creative juices.  Well, at least most of them.

All that to say, sometimes I think about deactivating my twitter account.  And I dream of days where socializing is not perpetuated through facebook.  Sigh.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I stated before that I do not make a habit of debating politics.

Just in case you forgot.

However, consider this quote from the President regarding last night's historical event (via Twitter.  Yes, you can follow the prez on twitter, and it's not his teleprompter, either).

"This is major reform.  This is what change looks like."

No freakin' way, really?  Remind me again...what does change look like?

Wow, do we have a candidate for Captain Obvious.

(I am not going to argue for or against the health care reform bill, by the way.  No comments here.  You can discuss/debate all you want, but I won't be included.  That's not the point.)]]></content:encoded>

-cut my finger with an exacto knife.

-locked my car key (and wallet, etc.) in my car.  It was still hanging from the ignition.  And the only reason I noticed my keys were missing was because I needed to unlock ze auto to pop the hood.  Why did I need to pop the hood?  Why, to jump start ze auto, of course.  Why did I need to jump start ze auto?  Duh.  <em>(I think it's a malfunctioning starter.)</em> The only thing I had not locked my car was my phone.  Thank God for friends!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mia: </strong>Don't you hate that?
<strong>Vincent:</strong> What?
<strong>Mia</strong>: Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about [blankityblank]  in order to be comfortable? <strong> </strong>

<strong></strong><strong>Vincent: </strong>I don't know. That's a good question.
<strong>Mia</strong>:  That's when you know you've found somebody special. When you can just  shut the [blankityblank] up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence. ﻿

I probably wouldn't have put it precisely that way, but I agree wholeheartedly.  There are not many who treasure silence anymore, especially in this cultureless culture.  I grow weary of small talk.  It exhausts me. In a circle of people, I am more often than not the listener and observer, and thus become labeled as the Shy One.  (Which is not accurate, by the way; there is a difference between shyness and introvert tendencies.  That is a whole 'nother post.  I digress.)

I would rather listen, think, and then speak a few worthwhile words, rather than just filling the air with bubbles to pop.  I don't know; maybe it's the introvert inside of me, maybe it is my infant cynicism, perhaps some of both.   But I think it would do many of us some good to just shut up once in a while, and not just when you are in the presence of that someone special.

*Just for the record, I wouldn't recommend <em>Pulp Fiction </em>to everyone.  When it comes to Tarantino, I watch for form (brilliant form, at that) rather than content.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I actually don't have a list written out, just some things in mind that I'd like to have read by the end of summer.  But I call it my summer reading list, anyway, just to make myself feel good.  ;)

<strong>Currently reading</strong> (I have book ADD, so help me)<strong>:</strong>

<em>Leave Me Alone, I'm Reading </em>by Maureen Corrigan.  A literature professor reflects upon her life in relation to different plots/themes found in literature.  Only a couple chapters in so far; so far, a pleasure.

<em>Things Fall Apart b</em>y Chinua Achebe.  Been meaning to finish this one for a while.  It's not often I get to read a novel authored by a non-Westerner, and an excellent one at that.

<em>Sense and Sensibility. </em>'nough said.

<em>The Betrayal</em> by Douglas Bond.  A historical novel on John Calvin.  I haven't read a good "Christian" historical fiction work in quite a while, and I am really enjoying this one.  Calvin?  Yes.  I am a seminary  nerd.

<em>The Bible and the Future </em>by Anthony Hoekema.  Thanks to a theological conversation partner, Doyle, for recommending this one.  Finally, a book on eschatology NOT given from a dispensational premillennial view.  Something to chew on.

<strong>Next up:</strong>

<em>Vintage Church </em>by Mark Driscoll.

<em>The Thing Around Your Neck </em>by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

<em>A Million Miles in a Thousand Years </em>by Don Miller.

Anything else I should be reading?

What are you reading this summer?]]></content:encoded>

				<title>I’m Sorry cards</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Working a retail job one Saturday afternoon, I helped a woman move her walker from her car to inside the store.

After I pointed her to the greeting cards, and set the walker down so she could sit in it while perusing the cards, she asked me if there were any "I'm sorry cards."

"Uhm, I don't think so, but I'll look."  I knew I had never seen any inside this store.

Bible bookstore.  Wouldn't this place carry I'm Sorry cards?  (You'd think.)

After my search come up dry, the woman began to tell me that she had come looking <em>specifically</em> for an I'm Sorry card, and proceeded to tell me why.  As she opted for the Thank You cards and enlisted my help in finding just the right one, she got further into her story, and began to weep tears of regret (2 Corinthians 7 came to mind, particularly verse 10).  Unsure of what to do or say, I ran (well, not literally, but almost) to a tissue box, took it, returned to the woman and offered her the box.  She took quite a few tissues, as is to be expected.

An older woman, just out of surgery from the VA hospital, in search of an I'm Sorry card. Coming up dry.  Crying her eyes out.  She was really sorry, and didn't have the right card.  I was beginning to feel sorry, myself.

Pondering this situation much later, I wondered if the lack of I'm Sorry cards  pointed to a much larger problem in Christendom. <em>(At this point, this is where you may want to stop reading if you do not wish to unravel different thoughts and attempt tying them together.  I am quite capable of making my own head hurt, along with yours.) </em> Perhaps we have lost the art of saying "I'm sorry" and truly meaning it.  Maybe we have treated "repentance" too flippantly for the sake of keeping on a serene holy mask that would fool anyone, letting pride sit on our hearts, slowly eating away, just like a lazy worm.

After doing a preliminary search for Apology cards, I discovered that they are quite difficult to locate and obtain, although they do exist.  Then a random piece of trivia came to me, a piece that I had probably read in one of hundreds (thousands?) of books I've flipped through (the problem with working with books year after year is that one can arbitrarily come up with little pieces of information, and have little recollection of how that information got into one's brain).  The piece of information in my brain said something like:  constantly saying "I'm sorry"  reflects a low image of oneself.  Call it "low self-esteem" (self-esteem would be a whole 'nother blog post, so I'll avoid becoming side-tracked).

Hm.  If this is how people think, no WONDER Apology cards are hard to find.

Although, that piece of information is quite legitimate in some aspects.  I could see situations in which that would be very applicable, to which I will leave to your imagination.  But flip the coin.  Wouldn't that also be indicative of pride?  Apologizing more than necessary to avoid punishment?   Saying three little words to sweep it all under the rug and say, All gone now.  Done.  No worries.

"I am sorry."  Those three words have certainly depreciated.

As people in general, it would be nice if more could <em>truly</em> say, "I'm sorry."

But take it back to the Bible bookstore.  How many books would you find on, say,  conflict resolution, community life, repentance, reconciliation?  Not many.  How many books would you find on Becoming a Better Version of oneself?  Too many.  As followers of Christ, we have to learn to live with each other, not just one person (myself, yourself).  That means having to say, "I'm sorry" and not just saying it.  None of us is better than the other, and none of us are above screwing up.  We need to show others what "I'm sorry" means.  (Check out 2 Corinthians and Philippians, just to name a couple of resources on living as family in the kingdom.)

P.S. Just so we're clear, I am far from having this whole thing down.

P.P.S. I think apology cards are only the beginning, but they need to be more easily found.

P.P.P.S I am not surprised that apology cards were nowhere to be found in that store, and difficult to be found anywhere else.  After all, [insert dry tone here] according to Joel Osteen, aren't you supposed to be <em>Activating Your Faith</em> and <em>Achieving Your Dreams</em>?  Come, now.  Who has time for I'm Sorry cards?  Think positive.

P.P.P.P.S.  Forgiveness deserves a separate blog post, too.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The number of things that have had to be repaired in ze auto this year: about six.

The number of people who have gotten engaged/married this year: I've lost track.

The number of times I've injured myself in the past twelve months: three. That's a record.

Out of those three injuries, the number of times I've injured my feet: twice.  Right foot, inside metatarsal tendon.  Left foot, outside metatarsal tendon.  What are the odds?  (Well, with my royal clumsiness, really high, actually.)

The number of times I've had to speak with B of A this year: twice too many.  (Time to switch.)

The number of times I've eaten a bowl of popcorn for dinner in the past ten months: umm.......???

The number of books I've gotten for free the past ten months: maybe twenty?

The number of books I've touched in the past ten months: I'm guessing around ninety thousand, give or take a little.

The number of cookies I've eaten: a lady never tells.

The number of pages I've read in the past year: sorry, lost track.

The number of Lara bars I've consumed the past year: around two hundred and fifty.

The number of poems I've composed this year: too few.

The number of stories I've written in the past few years: [blank]

The number of babies that have greeted this evil world in 2010 or will be before the year has past: that I know of?  About fourteen, at least.

The number of times I've tallied stuff like this to a T: never.  I haven't even given you numbers for everything.

Happy summer!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tell yourself you <em>really </em>don't want OR need to read this.  Tell yourself it's a complete waste of time!  Boring!  Sleep-inducing!  Truly!

Consider yourself warned, then I shall proceed.

1) Are you still reading?  Go away!

2)  I had this gut feeling (whatever you want to call it)  that this year would be different from the past few years, and by golly, my gut was right.  I've got a new job I'll absolutely love, dear friends old and new, a cute place to live, and for better or worse, a new and different grad school that is partially the same as it has always been.  Oh, and I made the student council.  Look out, world.

3) Not to mention new ministry opportunities.  The ESL students at church are going through <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Living-Book-Howard-Hendricks/dp/0802408168">Living by the Book</a></em>, and I get to help teach!  I'm excited to see what else I can pack into my schedule....right.

4) Still reading?  There's no hope for you, I'm afraid.

5) Last, but certainly NOT least, Roomie is getting married to Rascal tomorrow.  Never thought I'd live to experience the day(s) of living with a preoccupied, bedazzled, forgetful, bride-to-be.  Okay, well, that is not entirely true.  I figured these kinds of days would come soon enough.  I'm nearing 30 quite rapidly, after all.

6)  <em>STILL</em> reading?!?!  I sentence you to at least a two sentence comment!  There!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[..I'm actually going to need a semi-grown-up planner for this upcoming school year.  No more of those simple monthly spreads.

I have this perspicuous reminder in front of me ; I'm getting older, and I forget more things every school year.

Ergo, the planner.

Dang it, I knew I shouldn't have already made a rough time map, but as they say about me, curiosity kills.  (I have a million lives, though, so no worries there.)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[sometimes, you just run fresh out of ideas.  your brain feels all dried up. bone dry.

so, you brainstorm.  then what?  free-write, hoping something will just magically appear and take shape from among the nonsensical string of symbols?  no?

what do you do, then?  drink more coffee, take more vitamins, hoping for an increase in brain performance?  or, if you’ve been in dark, do you sit in the sun?  what if that doesn’t work?  what happens then?  do you throw your pencil against the wall, take an angry hand and attack the ruined pieces of paper, scrunching them into misshapen balls, and tossing them all over the room, then throw yourself on the couch and mope around?  no?  do you take a walk outside?  do you wander around inside?  do you pick up the remote and surf mindlessly through all the television channels? do you watch twitter like a hawk, hoping for the appearance of a nice writing prompt?  do you go to work in the kitchen, cooking and baking and eating to forget?  do your laundry?  madly clean house, even though it’s not really dirty?  knit, crochet, cross-stitch, sew?  take your frustration out on the piano, djembe, guitar, saxophone, drum set?  do you read someone else’s work?  do you go work in the garden, relishing in the smell of dirt and herbage?  do you play scrabble or words with friends, looking for a new word of inspiration?

do you change environments, plant yourself in a coffee shop or a bar for a while?  do you call up an unsuspecting friend for coffee, breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, or a drink, then proceed to bewail your writers-block misery, dumping all your sorrows on him/her?  or do you just call up a friend and get straight to the sorrow-dumping?  do you get in your car and drive to nowhere in particular, blasting the music or ruminating in silence?  do you take a run to nowhere in particular?  hop on your bike for a long ride?

do you break out the music, turn up it real loud, and dance ‘til you drop?  or sing loudly ‘til your heart pops?

or do you do nothing, and just hope and pray for eventual inspiration?

no?  what do you do, then?  are you writing your story?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like Seattle.  It is home to some of my favorite coffee shops, favorite bookstores, favorite ice cream, favorite scenery, favorite buildings, favorite people, favorite chocolate, favorite weather, among other things.</p> <p>In this city, I can usually share about my faith in a nonchalant manner, and receive neither an overtly negative nor positive response.  This usually results because someone, (who sits, or stands across or beside me as we wait for some function/event, or stand in line, or share a coffee shop table, or wait for the bus) in doing their small talk duties, will ask about my background.  After I respond, they nod and say, oh, that's nice! and perhaps inquire with a benign, follow-up question or two.</p> <p>I spoke with a woman the other night.  A very intelligent, congenial, beautiful, older woman.  I remember her green eyes and dyed red hair, but  I don't know even know her name.  She sat next to me and began to talk animatedly, as we anticipated the introduction of an admired philosopher, underneath the starry ceiling of a temple.</p> <p>She began with chit-chat topics, and eventually got to the infamous "what do you do."</p> <p>Most people do not expect from the likes of me the kind of answer I give them.  MDiv student, yadayada, books, etc.  Oh, what will you do with that? they ask.  Be a nun?  (Okay, actually, that's not fair.  I've only gotten that response a couple times.  But still.)</p> <p>Instead, this woman was very attentive and wide-eyed as I explained my aspirations, and she was full of encouraging words as she proceeded to  relate to me how her parents had been missionaries in Japan for over 40 years, but she and her late husband were not particularly "religious."  She remarked that in her life observations, it did not seem to matter what kind of "faith" someone claimed to have; no matter what their religious alliance is, that faith has been rendered null and void unless that person's life reflected change.  Claiming a faith means nothing unless others can see what tangible difference it makes in your life.</p> <p>Quite an accurate and interesting observation, from someone who claims no faith.   I thought she was just repeating James, you know.  But the manner and content of her communication did not relay such knowledge.  She was earnest with that statement, and she hit the nail on the head.</p> <p>Then I got to thinking...perhaps...this is WHY it's so easy to be open with one's faith around here.  Nobody cares, because it's mostly just talk. So, who gives a fig about what you believe?  It's fine to be "spiritual" anyway you like....right, 'cause everybody knows you won't truly act on it.  Laziness and apathy.  Apathy and dishonesty.  Hypocrisy.  Ouch.  In the end, apathy becomes our greatest enemy.</p> <p>Something is very wrong with that picture, people.  Especially if you claim to know, love, and follow Jesus, yes?  Do others see that?</p><p>...yes?  How do you know?</p><p>...no?  Well, what in the world are you going to do about it?</p> <p>I hope you act prayerfully.  If you don't want to act, I suggest you have a good, long conversation with God about why.</p><p>And let's keep this kind of stagnate-producing-apathy at bay.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here, in the South (now, I realize Virginia is only the tip of the iceberg; I have not experienced the deep South), there is an air of nationalism that makes me nervous.  There seems to be an expectation that if you love God, you will be unwavering in your patriotism, and always vote Republican.  This expectation is one of the reasons that I've been avoiding Baptist churches, since they always seem to be the most nationalistic. (I could go off on a rabbit trail here, but I choose not to.  If you want to know what I mean about nationalism, ask me in a different forum.)

So, if I'm avoiding Baptist churches, what's left?

In the past, I've been a part of the <a href="http://www.efca.org">EFCA</a>, and <a href="http://www.ifca.org">IFCA</a> (admittedly, my church was fairly progressive for the IFCA).  I write the IFCA off, because, you know, it's the South.  What happens when one combines fundamentalism and the Southern spirit?  I don't really want to know.  No offense.

I look up the EFCA, and find a church that is several miles away.  It seems to be a fairly conservative, run of the mill, evangelical church.  No problem, right?

Introduce Sabrina's Problem.  Or, if you will, Sabrina's Quest.

I've been finding over the past several years that typical evangelical churches leave me wanting for something more (yes, the church I grew up with).  You've got your worship teams + slides for music, your once-a-month communion, the focal point of the service, which is the sermon.  There's usually no good visual art, lending itself to worship.  Add to the fact that seminary has ruined my ability to politely sit in church and take everything in without analysis; this means I examine everything. (Not that I never examined anything before, but seminary just gave me more ammo.) In summary, a typical evangelical service does nothing for my spiritual personality, unless the sermon feeds my mind &amp; soul.

I've been slowly discovering that my mind &amp; soul need to connect with something more meaningful than praise songs and a sermon and communion once a month.  I need substance and beauty that I can see AND hear.  I need some kind of connection with a tradition.  (Last year, I was blessed to have the opportunity to plan a Sunday communion service for my beloved IFCA church in which I may have threw some for a loop, but I am not counting on that opportunity again anytime soon.)

Well, there are a couple United Methodist churches down the street.  Okay.  Over all, pretty watery for Sabrina.  Watery sermon, bland music, although the sanctuary was gorgeous.

There's also an Episcopal church down the street.  Not my first choice, for a number of reasons, but I want to see if highly structured liturgy feeds me, and if the beauty of the old church lends to worship.  There's beautiful, historic liturgy.  An okay sermon that did little for me.  Hymns accompanied by organ and choir.  A gorgeous place of worship.  A focus on communion.  But...something seemed missing to my evangelical self.  There's a prayer for the dead that I don't understand, an overall sense of dullness amongst the parishioners, and I already mentioned the sermon.

I think I can do better, so I look up the <a href="http://anglicanchurch.net">ACNA</a>, find Church of the Good Shepherd, and write the pastor, asking for a ride on Sunday.  I received a very gracious response, and when I finally made it on Sunday, everything clicked.  A beautiful chapel, scripture saturated &amp; historic liturgy, a good sermon, animated worship, focus on communion.  Boom.

But Sabrina...Anglican?

Maybe.  Look for part two sometime next week.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was my third week at Church of the Good Shepherd (a part of the <a href="http://www.anglicanchurch.net">ACNA</a>), and I enjoyed it immensely.  I am finally getting used to the flow of the liturgy, although I don't hope to have much else memorized soon.  In this post I'll touch on some of the things I really appreciate about the Anglican way.  There are heavier, theological issues at hand, but I am not well equipped to discuss those issues yet, as I have just recently begun studying the Anglican tradition.  The following are some aspects that relate to me, according to my spiritual personality.

What resonates with me the most can be boiled down to one broad category, which I will unpack as we go along:

<strong>Anglican liturgy.</strong>

I realize that all churches have their own sort of liturgy.  The churches with which I am most familiar all have unwritten, informal liturgies.  There is singing, perhaps scripture reading, prayer, more singing, maybe a "greeting" time sermon, an offertory somewhere in there, announcements somewhere in there too,  and more singing, and then dismissal. Communion is mostly likely a monthly occasion.  All good and well, but there is a vast contrast between this liturgy and Anglican liturgy.

In the informal liturgical setting, the congregation participates little.  We sing, we greet others.  But we mostly just take things in through hearing (singing, preaching), and perhaps through observing words on a screen or bulletin, or reading scripture.  There is nothing inherently wrong with this, nothing at all.  I do wonder, however, what kind of picture we are painting of community, as a crowd that just sits and listens, and this is where Anglican liturgy comes in.

Anglican liturgy is formal, and written, currently taken from the Book of Common Prayer.  There are songs and hymns, of course. There are four scripture readings in which the church participates by thanking God together after the scripture is read.  There are antiphonal prayers.  There are congregational prayers of petition and confession.  The Nicene Creed is recited together.  There is sitting, there is standing (and shifting to face the Gospel book [or cross] when the Gospel scripture for that Sunday is read), and there is kneeling for the petition and confession, with an opportunity for both individual (space for silent prayer) and corporate petition and confession.  In a word, Anglican liturgy is interactive.  To me, this speaks more of community, more of action.

There are also perks in a written liturgy for a visual learner like me.  I can read the prayers as they are written, as I listen to them being prayed.  What's more (and I am not implying that unwritten prayers are inferior), some of the most beautiful prayers I've heard were written down first.  As an avid reader and amateur writer, I always look for beauty in words.

Within the Anglican liturgy, there is a crescendo that sounds differently than it does in informal liturgical settings.  In the latter, the preacher and sermon are the focal point of the service.  In Anglican liturgy, the entire service builds up to the crescendo that is communion (or, Eucharist, Lord's Supper, etc.).  The sermon is not neglected, but this shift of emphasis is intriguing to me.  I wonder about all the weight that is put on preachers to make them into a type of celebrity, while communion is only celebrated once a month.

This leads to the question...why do you go to church?  Is it for the preacher's sermon?  Or something else?

That is for another blog, another day, friend.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>pessimism, her cohorts, and her enemies</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've always viewed myself as an idealist. I can dream up ideal situations of any kind. I dream of a utopia, where everything works as it should, people treat each other with respect and kindness, and give God's creation the care that it should receive. I dream a lot.

In my mind, I am aware of the reality of sin, but that reality hasn't sunk in. It remains a concept that lives only in my head, for the most part.

You can imagine what happens when actual reality, the kind that doesn't live in head, collides with the utopia I have inside my head. It's not pretty. It usually results in pessimism and loss of hope, which eventually leads to a wicked cynicism.

Picture this:

<em>A tranquil, bright blue body of water surrounded by trees, birds singing, the sun shining brightly but not too hot. You are in a canoe, humming happily, peacefully paddling to nowhere, but eventually hoping to reach the other side of the water. Suddenly the water becomes very murky and thick, and it becomes harder to paddle. The water is almost like mud. You furiously paddle harder and faster, and only manage to inch along. About twenty feet later, a fin pokes its way through the surface on the right side of the canoe, and on the left side, you glimpse a crocodile snout. Losing all hope, you stop paddling. What's the point? You're just going to be eaten, anyway. And nobody will come to help.</em>

After my ideals collide with reality, I begin to dream again. But these dreams are not happy dreams. In these dreams I imagine everything that could possibly go wrong, and WHAT IFS flood every space in my imagination. It's paralyzing.

It's difficult for a person in this situation to actively cling to hope. And I'm not even speaking of an individual who is going through legitimate suffering.

This applies to my current writing habits. I try and think of things to write, and then promptly shoot them down with the excuse that better people are already thinking and writing about those things, and much better than I ever could. Thus, I don't write. Other criticisms emerge, such as: <em>don't use your blog as a journal, that's sappy stuff nobody wants to read. Don't blog that, that doesn't sound theologically coherent. </em>And the list goes on.

<img style="float: right;" title="pessimism2.jpg" src="http://www.sabrina-peters.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pessimism2.jpg" alt="Pessimism2" width="240" height="240" hspace="10" />

It's easy to to abandon optimism and hope in exchange for pessimism and cynicism.

But, and this I tell (and pack the punch to) myself as well as everybody else who struggles with pessimism (you might even be reading this, who knows?): abandoning hope is stupid. Abandoning joy is stupid. Especially if you believe what scripture says is true. You have the best Hope of all hopes to cling to, and it's the last reason in the world to give up.

So, don't give up. Don't give in. Pursue joy like you're training for a marathon, and cling to hope like a gnarly burr on a wool sweater. And dwell on this with me:

<em>Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. According to His great mercy, He has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead (!) 1 Pt 1.3</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I think part of me is just rebelling against the multi-tasking, fast paced, materialistic Western culture. We focus on quantity rather than quality. Maybe another part of me is just annoyed at premature pictures of Christmas trees. Maybe my natural inclination towards liturgy is offended by the former. Regardless, it has me thinking...

The conflation of the seasons troubles me (and here I am referring mostly to seasons on the liturgical calendar, followed loosely by most in my circles). And no, it's not that I'm just a humbug (though sometimes I can be). There's a certain sacredness to every season that is meant to be savored alone: Lent, Easter, Thanksgiving, Advent, etc. To dive into the Christmas season before Advent seems sacrilegious, because Advent has been specifically set aside to dwell on the coming of Christ in human flesh. It is full of anticipation, beauty, hope, and awe. We sense a longing for the Messiah, at the same time knowing he came to earth as a human infant, and rejoicing in the peace that he brings to earth with the advent of salvation.

I'm not trying to imply that we should never look forward to Jesus' coming outside of the Advent season, or to only acknowledge Jesus' resurrection on Easter, but some things tend to lose their significance as we multi-task and multi-observe. It takes discipline to focus only on one thing, and to keep focus on it. There is a sense of wonder, awe, and gratitude that is restored as we reflect on one season, and realize, through focusing singularly on that one season, what we might have missed all the other times we just skimmed over it, or tried to do too many things at once. It's time for many of us to slow down, and reflect.

<em>p.s.</em> I have nothing against multi-tasking, personally; I just fail to see its usefulness in every area of life. If you thrive on multi-tasking, kudos to you, but I sure hope you find time to slow down a little, and ruminate. It just might make a difference.]]></content:encoded>

Advent is here!!  I cannot express just how much I love this season; not because of the consumeristic Christmas that America celebrates, but because it's the beginning of a new church year, and it's the anticipation of the Savior's birth. It's my delight to share some Advent resources to assist you as you meditate upon this season.

(If you didn't read my thoughts on using disciplines of season, go <a href="http://pensamientosconfusos.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/the-discipline-of-seasons">here</a>.  For a introductory explanation of the church calendar, and an insight as to why I love following the liturgical calendar, Glenn Packiam has some thoughts <a href="http://glennpackiam.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/02/what-is-ash-wednesday-why-celebrate-lent.html.">here.</a>)

Note: this list is rather ecumenical, but that's not a bad thing!  I encourage you to see what other resources you can use beside your usual stand-bys.  You might be surprised at the treasures you find.

Let me share with you a couple of links directly related to Advent that I wish I could've written, myself.  Glenn Packiam has written <a href="http://glennpackiam.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/11/how-advent-can-be-much-more-than-the-christmas-season.html?fb_action_ids=10200220009201665&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=aggregation&amp;fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582">here</a> about taking the time and space to make Advent about more than just Christmas, and has some Advent resources <a href="http://glennpackiam.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/11/advent-resources.html">here</a> to assist you in reflecting upon this season.

Word of Life Church has constructed an Advent reading guide, which you can find <a href="http://wolc.com/blog/2012/11/advent-scripture-reading-guide/">here</a>.

John Piper is giving away a free eBook called <em>Good News of Great Joy </em><a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/good-news-of-great-joy-free-advent-ebook">here</a>.

Ann Voskamp is giving away a Jesse Tree Advent Devotional <a href="http://www.aholyexperience.com/2010/11/free-jesse-tree-advent-devotional-book/">here</a>.

For more of a somber perspective of Christmas, see Dr. Varner's post <a href="http://dribex.tumblr.com/post/36958073142">here</a>, giving an overview of <em>A Not So Silent Night</em>.  Dr. V will be sharing about Christmas devotionals throughout the season, so make you sure you re-visit his blog.

Christine Sine has a wonderful list of Advent resources on her <a href="http://godspace.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/resources-for-advent/">blog</a>, and created a Facebook event page for Advent resources that she updates weekly: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/284602891643311/">Join Us for Advent. </a>

The Jesuit Post has a short, but rich and eclectic list of Advent resources on their <a href="http://thejesuitpost.org/site/2012/12/making-a-list-checking-it-all-through-advent/">blog</a>.

My friend G. recommends these devotional/prayer books for the Advent season: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Watch-Light-Readings-Advent-Christmas/dp/1570755418/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354475919&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=watch+for+the+light+advent"><em>Watch for the Light</em></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Preparing-Christmas-Daily-Meditations-Advent/dp/1616364785/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354475945&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=preparing+for+christmas+richard+rohr"><em>Preparing for Christmas </em></a>(Rohr), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Christmastide-Prayers-Advent-Through-Epiphany/dp/0385510268/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354475984&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=christmastide"><em>Christmastide</em></a> (Tickle), and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Be-Vigilant-Meditations-Advent-ebook/dp/B002XULHZC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354475855&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=be+vigilant+advent"><em>Be Vigilant: Daily Meditations for Advent</em></a> (Duburiel; only 99 cents on Kindle right now!)

What other Advent resources have you found helpful?  How do you make the most of the Advent season?  Please share in the comments section!  I will continue to expand this post to include a collection of Advent resources (or even helpful anecdotes) as you share them.]]></content:encoded>

<p>Just for fun, here are some things I wish I had taken to heart, back when I was a young biblical languages student (and, really, some of this can apply to any Bible student, not just the Greek geeks).</p>
<p>1) Work hard.  A good grade doesn't mean you've mastered it.  At the same time, try to get more sleep. :)  It actually helps.</p>
<p>2) Greek isn't everything.  Neither is Hebrew.  Don't get hung up on parsings and definitions unless <em>absolutely necessary</em>.  You might find that it's more seldom than you thought.</p>
<p>3) Watch your pride.  Who do you think you are? Pride sneaks up on the best ones, and even leaks out in a humble form. I mean, you gotta admit that you're always looking for subtle ways to impress with your language skills:  <em>Listening to someone trying to explain John 1:1 in their story of an encounter with JWs, and they obviously don't know Koine Greek.</em> "Oh yeah, uh, I know a little bit of Greek."  "REALLY?  You must be so smart!  Can you read fluently? Can <em>you</em> explain the Greek in John 1.1?!  What about in John 21.15-17? "  <em>They take out their Bible, and flip to a favorite New Testament passage. "</em>What does the Greek say here?" <em>As though it really makes a great difference, heh heh.  I know better. </em> *<em>Pats self on back.* </em> Being a languages geek doesn't put you above everybody else.  Stop it.</p>
<p>4) Just because that preacher didn't get his Greek right, does not mean his sermon has been completely spoiled.  Be kind, not critical.</p>
<p>5) Just because that preacher didn't insert a comment about the original language into his sermon, does not make him inferior.</p>
<p>6) Stop stressing out about getting perfect answers 100% of the time, and enjoy the learning experience.</p>
<p>7) I know you hear it all the time, but seriously, if you don't practice/use Hebrew and Greek, you'll lose them.  So, if you want to retain anything, practice it.  Keep reading it.  There are no other substitutes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Or,<em> How Sabrina is Coping Poorly Outside of Her Natural Habitat.</em>

I miss Trader Joe's.

That can pretty much sum it all up.

But I'll explain, because that makes a better story.

Okay.  I've lived within reasonable proximity to a Trader Joe's (2-4 miles) for the past 8 years or so (and Whole Foods, but they're becoming over-rated).  Oh, you don't know what a Trader Joe's is?  Let me fix that.

Trader Joe's is essentially a haven for wanna-be foodies who have a budget, hippies who desire vegetarian, organic, and alternative fare, and it is also friendly to those who live gluten-free.  In Southern California, Trader Joe's is frequented by yuppies; in the PNW, well, Trader Joe's is a given for almost anybody.  There you can find the yummiest coconut milk ice cream, the cheapest organic spaghetti sauce, the tastiest dark chocolate covered almonds with sea salt, some of the most innovative food creations, cheap, organic veggies, the best junk food paraded as healthy food, and mostly, I was a very happy human being shopping there.

For four of those years, I've lived in the Pacific Northwest, where I naturally acclimated as a nerd, quasi-hippie, musician, bookworm, and an individual who is generally interested in the arts.  Health food stores are a given there (Marlene's was the best!  Who knew local health food stores could have such lovely delis!), and vegans are so common that no one bats an eyelash in encountering one.  I was safe, happy, and comfortable in this environment.  I shopped every week at Trader Joe's, because, for the things that I normally buy, it was the least expensive option.  When I first moved to the PNW, Trader Joe's was a welcome, familiar place.  I also frequented Marlene's…surprise, surprise.

I moved to the South in July.  And boy oh boy, was there plenty of culture shock in the food department.  Nearest Whole Foods?  60 minutes away.  Trader Joe's? Around the same.  Nearest health food store (a tiny one, without a deli)?  A good 6 miles away.  The nearest grocery store?  Kroger.  The only grocery stores in town?  Food Lion, and...Kroger.  I've had to reassemble life without inexpensive access to organic baby carrots, natural peanut butter, free-range chicken, gluten-free snickerdoodles, sweet potato chips, organic olive oil, vinho verde, and…basically everything I'm used to snacking on.  Any (rare) equivalent I might find at Kroger's is around 100% more expensive.

The funny thing is, Trader Joe's requires a high collegiate population in order to place a store in that city.  Lynchburg is teeming with undergraduate and graduate students.  Why no Trader Joe's?  Why?

And it's not just Trader Joe's I'm missing.  I still mope over the fact that I can't pop over to Metropolitan Market and grab a vegan, gluten-free cupcake.  Those kind of cupcakes don't exist in Lynchburg.  I'd have to scrounge up the ingredients to make them myself, and would seriously luck out if I didn't have to spend half a day traveling to find them.  BUT.  I would be very happy if there was just a Trader Joe's nearby.

There's something to be said for eating familiar foods; it's good for the soul, don't you think?  Somehow, everything else will be okay, as along as I can put familiar foods in my belly.  But for now, there's an ache in my belly and consequently, my soul, because they miss Trader Joe's.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is not the day for problem-solvers to get into debates about causes and solutions.  I understand that people grieve in certain ways, but, debates are the absolute<em> last thing</em> that grieving families, whose hearts are screaming out against evil and injustice, who are crying in pain, want to hear, and need to hear.  They don't want solutions; they want and need love and compassion.  They don't need to hear about gun-control, or stronger security measures; they need emotional, physical, spiritual, and psychological support.  While problem-solving has an appropriate time and place, its time is not now.</p>
<p>So, for the love of God and love of neighbor, mourn with those who mourn.  </p>
<p>Love.  Pray.  Listen.  Pass the peace. </p>
<p>The LORD is near to the brokenhearted, and saves the crushed in spirit.</p>

I am currently sick with what seems to be a sinus infection/cold, but once I am fully recovered, you can expect my usual content, plus, I am brainstorming for a couple of new blog series (if you have a topic you'd like to see covered someday, read my About page, and then comment below), and will be adding more book reviews. I still have a separate poetry page for now: <a href="http://notemily.wordpress.com">http://not-emily.wordpress.com</a>

That's enough about me. :)  How are you this Tuesday?  How did January 2013 treat you?  What is different about 2013 than 2012?]]></content:encoded>

				<title>why i need lent</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I attended my first Ash Wednesday service this year, a little over two weeks ago.

I had observed Lent before, but never in an Anglican context. I observed Lent because I thought it could be a beneficial discipline. As it turns out, though, Lent is not just about discipline.

<em>One of the reasons I've come to love the Anglican tradition is the manner in which communion is treated. The Eucharist is treated with obvious awe, reverence, care, seriousness, and joy. This is something I'd rarely experienced outside Anglicanism.</em>

As I helped to prepare the altar] for communion this Ash Wednesday, the importance of the Eucharist was poignant as great care was taken to place and position the white linen, the chalices, the plate, and the bread. I felt a sense of anticipation and excitement as I thought about celebrating communion again, on Ash Wednesday.

But after the opening prayer and scripture reading, along with the invitation to observe self-examination and repentance, followed this prayer:

<em>Almighty God, you have created us out of the dust of the earth: Grant that these ashes may be to us a sign of our mortality and penitence, that we may remember that it is only by your gracious gift that we are given everlasting life; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.</em>

The church then lined up, one by one. The [pastor] priest, with a finger covered in ashes, drew crosses on each of our foreheads, and spoke these words as he drew: <strong>"Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return."</strong>

I wasn't excited anymore.

When I consider the appeal of liturgical worship, especially during the lenten season, it occurs to me that many non-liturgical churches rarely have an ebb and flow in their worship. What do i mean by this? Well, with the exception of a (usual) monthly communion, church services are generally happy times. And if you're not happy, you are strongly encouraged to be happy. Of course, a sermon could lead you to reflection and repentance, but it is unlikely that happens every week. The Lenten season is a time when (an observing) church gathers, and as a unit, generally observes a 40 + day season of fasting, reflection/contemplation, and repentance in the pattern of Jesus' 40 days in the wilderness, in anticipation of Easter. Confession is moved to the beginning of the liturgy every Sunday, and there are no ALLELUIAs spoken within that liturgy. Everybody prayers this together before the Collect and the Lessons:

<blockquote>Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned again You in thought, word and deed, by what we have done, and by what we have left undone. We have not loved You with our whole heart; we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. We are truly sorry and we humbly repent. For the sake of Your Son Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and forgive us; that we may delight in Your will, and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your name. Amen.</blockquote>

I wasn't excited anymore. Instead, I was reminded of my human frailty, and felt hopeful, at the same time. There is nothing like fasting to prove how frail my spirit actually is, not to mention my body, but I am not alone, because Jesus was tempted in the wilderness. And I don't need to depend on myself, because <strong>the resurrection is the breath of life that I desperately need, and I need to be reminded that I need Jesus</strong>. In the mountains, in the valleys, in the wilderness, I need Jesus.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you know me, you know I am fairly (okay, maybe very) particular about the music I listen to.  I tend to be especially critical of the Contemporary Christian Music market, as well as some of the music that passes as "worship" music nowadays.  The music tends to be mediocre, and the lyrics tend to be, well, watery.  That is why I've gravitated more toward hymn-listening.  The problem with that is, it's been difficult to find nice renditions of hymns, besides the Indelible Grace project, which I discovered around the same time as Page CXVI.</p>
<p>When I discovered Page CXVI, I was ELATED.  They play hymns, don't necessarily change the traditional melody, and they have clean, easy pop sound that is fresh, meditative, and just plain lovely. Everyone I've recommended them to has enjoyed them immensely.  Sample one of their tracks:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F6671084" width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no"></iframe></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Come to discover a little later, Page CXVI is also The Autumn Film.  They were actually The Autumn Film before Page CXVI.  And they are celebrating their 7th year of making beautiful music together.  To help celebrate, they are giving away their <em>entire catalog of music </em>starting TODAY, for seven weeks!!!  That's 11 albums of music for FREE!!!  Ah!!!  How can you say, "no, thanks", to that?</p>
<p>Go and feast by clicking on the image below... </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>NOTE: So many excited fans have been taking advantage of Page CXVI's giveaway, that their site has been overwhelmed.  Please be patient; it will be well worth it!</p>

				<title>writing, reading, &amp; creativity, pt. 2</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.sabrina-peters.net/writing-reading-creativity-i/">part one</a> of "writing, reading &amp; creativity", I wrote about fear taking precedence over my desire to express creativity through writing. In this second part, I talk about how reading relates to my experience of creativity.

I don't remember being taught to read. My mother says I taught myself to read.  But she was responsible for teaching me letter sounds, so I'll give her the credit, whether she takes it or not. Books have been my best friends for as long as I can remember. I loved escaping into other worlds created by an author's use of words. Until I graduated high school, I often got in trouble for reading instead of doing my homework. I read whatever I wanted, whether novels or non-fiction, within certain boundaries established by parental authority.

I believe I was at my creative peak in junior high, and early high school years, and I wonder why I have been going downhill ever since. Is it because I didn't place boundaries on my reading and writing, or other creative activities? Is it because I didn't really use the Internet (and Facebook didn't exist)? Is it because of the energy I poured into academia? Or is it because childhood is naturally the most creative period in any person's life?

For the past decade or so, I have placed boundaries on my reading. I have said to myself, "Novels are not my thing anymore; they're too easy to read, and most likely not educational." Or, "if it's not a classic, I won't waste my time." Or, "This would look good on my shelf [make me look smart], who cares if I actually read it?"

Also in the past decade, I have poignantly felt my creativity declining, partially because of  limits I place on myself.

"I can't do that; I'm not creative."

"I can't draw."

"I don't have patience for [insert creative activity here]."

Etcetera.

I think the decline of creativity can be attributed, in part, to negative reinforcement, which is most of the time just blatant falsehood. Soon enough, those falsehoods are adopted as reality because I start to believe them. As a natural pessimist, it is quite easy to see negativity and speak it.

When I was a child and teenager, I didn't use the Internet very much. This was back in the day of dial-up modems and AOL, when I wrote long emails instead of Facebook posts or Myspace comments or tweets. As the wealth of information spread and social media became more prevalent and I read more from the Internet than books, my attention span shortened.  I could not concentrate amidst all the <a href="http://www.charlespeters.net/blog/2012/11/21/drowning-in-noise/">noise</a>; I have never been a great multi-tasker. It became more difficult to sit and write for long periods, or even read for more than 30 minutes at a time (who am I kidding? It's more like 15 minutes). My use of the Internet helped to destroy creativity, through the craving of information bytes rather than the printed word, and through the spend time in consuming those bytes.

All of this is not to mention homework. All of the time spent on reading and writing for classes left me with little energy to do any of those things recreationally, and trained me to see reading as a task, not as a pleasure.

It could just be that childhood and early adolescence is the most creative period, and childhood imagination is at its peak. I haven't done any studying on that topic, but it is very fascinating to me. (Education/psychology friends: do you have any insights???)

I want to get back in that place of unlimited, childhood creativity again. I want to stretch my imagination. I realize I will mostly likely not reach that identical place, but I would like to release some of the boundaries I placed on myself. One of the main ways I will begin (have already begun, actually, since graduation), is to read less, and to read more, at the same time. It may sound contradictory, but it's actually really simple.

It essentially breaks down this way:

Read more books. Read less Internet.

Currently, I'm on a novel kick. I'm reading every novel that looks interesting and well-written, giving it at least 20 pages before I decide whether to keep reading, or not. I also have a stack of books of my own, related to my field of study, that I intend to read sometime this year. But first, I will read more on subjects that I am not familiar with (basically, anything outside the realm of biblical studies and religion). The main point is not to place unnecessary limits on myself.

I also want to read less on the Internet, to devote more time to the printed word. I will pay less attention to social media and blogs, because, frankly, all the debates and arguments that sprout so easily from those word bytes can be very wearisome.

I don't think that slowing down, simplifying, and savoring in themselves will restore imagination and creativity, but it is definitely an excellent starting point for me. If you're willing to share, please do: to what do you attribute a loss of imagination? how do you cultivate (or re-cultivate) creativity and imagination?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been an avid reader and writer for as long as I can remember.  My mother can probably tell you when I wrote my first story, but I don't remember the exact day, because I don't (can't?) remember a day when I couldn't read or write.  I wrote short stories and poem throughout my teenage years, and to this day, my best poem is still the one I wrote for an early high school language arts assignment.

When I transitioned into college, I wrote differently.  I learned how to write academically, how to write to please the teachers, and how to craft my paper into a winningly persuasive argument.  Mechanics.  I remember my persuasive writing professor telling me over and over "how good" my writing was, but I only half-believed him.  I left creative writing alone, to tend to my grades.  For my British Lit class, I wrote a continuation for a play, and it received a better grade than my previous explications and analyses. <em> I began to wonder, Why have I neglected this kind of writing, this creative kinda stuff?</em>

I continued writing for classes and professors, summarizing and exegeting and arguing and analyzing and outlining and sometimes pontificating.  Towards the end of my undergraduate studies, I began a blog, because I had thoughts I needed to process for myself.  It was mostly in the same vein as what I was writing for other people, and sometimes in the same voice and tone as theirs.  You can see for yourself if you brave my archives (n.b.: my current opinions are just those; they do not reflect what opinions I may or  may not have possessed several years ago).

I ventured on into graduate studies, writing in the same vein as before, only more intensely and more frequently.  I posted on my little blog infrequently, because writing for academics sucked what little ambition I had to update it.

It was then I rediscovered poetry writing, and I felt a sense of creative renewal. It was wonderful! How could I tap into the creativity I had as a child?

Confession: even though I wrote "for myself on my blog", I was actually writing for people.  I liked to pretend I had a grand audience, and I thrived on positive remarks.

I used to think that attending seminars, conferences, and workshops would help me write more, to help me tap into creativity, but I've had a gradual epiphany, lately, thanks to the crash course of <a href="http://www.thestoryunfolding.com/story-101/">Story 101</a>, <a href="http://sarahbessey.com/in-which-i-mark-7-years-of-blogging-and-god-chuckles/">Sarah Bessey</a> (also <a href="http://sarahbessey.com/in-which-art-is-like-manna/">here</a>), and <a href="http://laurennicolelove.com/blog/grief/for-people-who-feel-they-fail-at-creativity/">Lauren Dubinsky</a>, and numerous tweets these past ten days that have more or less said the same thing.  Ever have one of those weeks when everything you read seemed to say the same thing?  Yeah, it was one of those.  And the message shouted at me was this one: DO NOT BE AFRAID.

I noticed, when my blog [I] took breaks, that these were my reigning thoughts: <em>I'm not interesting enough.  I don't have any ideas [that anyone would like].  I'm not that good of a writer, after all.  Who even reads this, anyway?  People don't like deep thinkers.  People are lazy.  I'm lazy.  I'm tired.</em>

I could easily convince myself to "take breaks", but in reality,  it was Fear holding me back.  I wanted to protect myself from criticism and rejection, the kind that my psyche interprets as a personal failing, a slap on the face of my identity .  That Fear  was accompanied by Pride.  That's the Pride that binges on the back-patting and acknowledgements of talent I only believe half-heartedly, even though it feels good to bask in the moment.

When I ponder what happened to my young creativity, I can't help but think it's Fear that's been growing larger and larger as I grow older.  Child-like trust and innocence? Not really.  As I learned what people could do, and how they hurt, my shades of Cynicism grew darker, and Fear and Pride held me close inside my warm shell.

Oh, laziness always peeks over my shoulder, but Fear and Pride are my constant companions.  And the only way to lose them is to do the opposite of what they tell me to do. So, I am doing just that.  I am writing.

I'm writing, because I can.  I'm writing, because this is the best way for me to tell any story, at all.  I'm writing, because I love words.  I'm writing, and as I write, I pry the fingers of Fear and Pride off my wrists, and find that creativity is not so far away, after all.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It occurred to me a little while ago that I've lived in Lynchburg for almost a year, and I have not written anything on what it's like to live here, after living in the West. After a little reading,<em> </em>I learned that the South is a hot climate culture, unlike the rest of the US, which is a cold climate culture. It was positively enlightening.  (I cannot recommend the little book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Foreign-Familiar-Understanding-Climate-Cultures/dp/1581580223/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370361140&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=foreign+to+familiar"><em>Foreign to Familiar</em></a> enough.)

I moved from the Pacific Northwest, which is a definite cold climate culture, to the South, which is the American version of hot climate. In a nutshell, this means that Southerners are generally more focused on community, rather than the individual. They are less focused on time, and direct communication. Community ties are strong, so relationship is very important; it matters which community you came from. It is no surprise, then, when I observed so many differences between the West coast and the South. Here are some quick, random observations.

I call Lynchburg "Jerrytown" or "Jerryville", with tongue-in-cheek. There is hardly a place I can go in Lynchburg where Jerry Falwell, Sr. has not left his footprint. Every time I turn around, Liberty University is buying another part of Lynchburg. Lynchburg would not be what it is without Jerry; in fact, Liberty alone drives the majority of Lynchburg's economy. This is not to mention the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Majority">Moral Majority</a>, which I'm sure has had major lingering effects on Lynchburg. This is where I live, and sometimes it stresses me out to see the LU mountain top monogram every time I look out of an apartment window of mine.

Lynchburg is a city of churches. In the Pacific Northwest, it is cool to be anything you want to be; nobody really cares, as long as you leave others alone. Christian? No problem. Wicca? Fine. Buddhist? Cool. Nothing? Even better. Here in Lynchburg, it's cool to be a Christian, or at least look like one or talk like one. Everybody talks about God, or church-going. It's expected. There are many Baptist churches, yes, but there are also a number of UMCs, and independent congregations.

People are slow here, in Lynchburg. Not simply easygoing; people live a slower pace of life. They travel slower. They walk slower. They (if a born and raised Southerner), talk slower. Business transactions take longer than I think they should. Even the bus drivers seem to dawdle, on occasion.

I used to think that a Southerner's way of friendliness was just nosiness.  Why do you need to know about my life? You're a complete stranger. Business is not just about business transactions; it is more important to be friendly and interested, so business transactions sometimes take longer than I think they should. It is not just about the task at hand. Friendliness and politeness is almost expected of everyone, and it is common to greet someone with a "hi, how are you?" instead of simply a "hello." I sometimes wonder if my co-workers think I'm being rude, but I am simply not as open as many of them are.

I love Portland, because I can dress however I want there, and no one will bat an eyelash. Here in the South, you are immediately noticed if you look different than anybody else.

I miss good coffee. The one coffeeshop that I liked, where the local hipsters and quasi-hippies hung out, had to close its doors recently. Now there are only two independent coffee shops in Lynchburg, and one Starbucks. For those wondering, Starbucks only counts as a last resort. Not surprisingly, learning to roast coffee is now high on my list of new things to try.

I mentioned this in another post, but there is no Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. There's not even a nicely sized and stocked health food store within reasonable distance (I am aware of Health Nut and Hannah's Health, for Lynchburgers who are reading this :)).  Also, recycling? I doubt too many people recycle here, because there is an obscene annual fee to pay in order to have the truck come and pick it up from your curbside. A Pacific Northwestern hippie can feel out of place in Jerrytown very easily, so it is no surprise that a quasi-<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=granola">granola</a>, as I am, feels out of place.

(And I didn't even mention the relative shortage of books.)]]></content:encoded>

				<title>mad men stories (post for a class assignment)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Here's a post I wrote for class, that I thought I would share while I work on another for this blog. Working every afternoon has left me too tired to write at night, and every morning has found me with homework. Once I finish classes, I'll begin writing in the mornings, again.</em>

<em>Context: most of the students in the class are Conservative Evangelicals, and I think most of them are Baptist. I'm the only female.  I could write about anything related to culture, so I chose this topic. I tread lightly, because the last thing I want to participate in is heated debate over an old argument.</em>

Mad Men, for those of you not familiar, is an award winning AMC drama following the lives of New York City ad executives and their families in the 1960s. The central character, Don Draper, plays a Creative Director for the firm Sterling Cooper, and later Sterling Cooper Draper Price. He's a brilliant and creative salesman who is conflicted about his identity, and lives a discontented double life. One side of Don Draper is what would appear to be a typical 1960s family man: he goes to work everyday, sometimes comes home at night to a dinner provided by his wife, provides more than enough for his family to live on, and his wife stays at home to look after their two children and manage the household. The other side of Don Draper is an unhappy womanizer who dulls his conflict of identity by drowning himself in alcohol and [extra-martial] sex.

Betty, Don's wife, is a beautiful, blonde, quintessential<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Feminine_Mystique"> Feminine Mystique era</a> housewife, who does nothing outside of home management. She cooks, does the grocery shopping, oversees her household help, gossips with her neighbor friends, does not work outside the home, plans and hosts parties and events, doesn't ask questions of her husband's job or money management, always looks polished, adheres to current social etiquette and ensures her children do the same, and escorts Don to his work-related shows, dinners, and parties. Based on outward appearances, Betty is the perfect stay-at-home wife and mother.

Being recently married (just past the three month mark) and still nerdy, gender roles are always at the forefront of my mind. I had already dismissed the aforementioned portrait of a housewife as a standard, since the times have changed drastically. I had already intellectually dismissed the idea that a stay-at-home wife is the only "biblical" way to be. So, why, up until last week, did I find myself attempting a failing impression of Betty Draper, or better yet, June Cleaver?

My initial thought: because of the culture of gender roles. Of course, one could say it's because my mother also a modeled for me what a wife and mother should look like (stay-at-home household manager), but in actuality, the only real examples of marriage I got close up, including that of my parents, were strangely like June and Betty's models. The wife stays at home, makes sure everyone has good food to eat, and keeps a clean and welcoming home. The husband goes to work and brings home the goods. It wasn't until my husband told me I should stop trying to act like June Cleaver and read more books (and write!), did it occur to me how deeply these gender roles had become ingrained in the Conservative Evangelical circles in which I grew up, and as a consequence, ingrained in myself. It bothered me a bit. Is this the way it should be?

Here's what I have concluded so far: gender make up is one thing and is God-given, but gender roles are socially constructed, for the most part. Not all men will be working outside of the home, and not all women will be working inside the home. Not even all women will be assuming the role of household manager, but instead operate their businesses from inside their home, and have someone else cook and clean. The boxes don't fit everyone. I think everyone should operate on the basis of what their natural skills and talents are, as well as doing what needs to be done for a season, regardless of socially constructed gender roles. I'd like to think of gender roles in more of a pragmatic way.

What's your experience with gender roles? What's you take on them? What's worked, and what hasn't? Do you think there is a biblical model for specific gender roles?

<em>P.S. I'm very thankful for a husband who encourages me to embrace who God made me to be, instead of trying to fit inside a stereotype.</em>]]></content:encoded>

				<title>sabrina has an mdiv. now what?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A week ago on Saturday, I graduated with a Master of Divinity from <a href="http://www.corban.edu/graduate/ministry/index.html">Corban University.</a>  Since this degree academically qualifies me to be a pastor, ever since I began pursing those studies, I'd get this question: "So...are you going to be a <em>pastor?" </em>In the beginning, I'd answer with an emphatic NO. A pastor preaches, and I can't/don't/won't preach. At first, I'd follow up that answer with a "because...women aren't supposed to preach. [DUH]" Well, then what in the world could women DO with a Master of Divinity? Teach, I suppose (but not preach, or teach Sunday School, etc.); lead worship, write curriculum, use it as a stepping stone to further education and scholarship; be a missionary, overseas, doing the work of a pastor but not given that title.

This was before I took a class on the Pastoral Epistles, and subsequently called into question my complementarian convictions.

The following year, as part of a class assignment, I took a few surveys that revealed some possible spiritual gifts, including shepherding/pastoring and teaching. My then roommate, who already had a bit of preaching and pastoral experience, took up teasing me about one day being a pastor. (Hi Faatima!) Ha. Nope. No pastoring. Only teaching, maybe, and maybe even through writing, so I don't actually have to talk.

Coincidentally, I also got an invitation to preach at Faatima's church by way of text message that semester, which I turned down, because I was already scheduled for music at my church. The pastor who sent the request called me a chicken; I distinctly remember laughing at that response, because it's partially true. But, I was going to teach at youth group, anyhow. Turns out, besides the prep work, presenting to this group of teenagers was more enjoyable than I thought.

A lot of things happened that semester. Did I mention taking Preaching I? Well, during that class, I told my classmates and my prof that I wasn't there to learn how to preach, because I didn't see myself as a preacher type. I think I repeated myself in Preaching II, where I got away with teaching the teenagers instead of preaching to a mixed crowd. No, I'm not pastor material, I told myself. I can write and teach, maybe, but I'm definitely not a pastor.

I still tell myself that. But, let's get back to the big question.

<em>So, now that you've got an MDiv, what are you gonna do, Sabrina? Are you going to be a pastor?  </em>I was asked that the day after I graduated. I told her that I didn't see myself as a pastor anytime soon, and left it at that.

<em>Are you going to pursue doctoral studies, Sabrina? </em>I got that question, too, more than once. I would answer like this: "Um...I'm going to say, no?"

<em>Well, what are you gonna do, now? </em> For now, I don't see myself pursuing further studies, because it's simply not financially feasible, although I may find myself wanting to after a year off. I am going to continue my part-time job at the library, be the foremost supporter of my husband's work, continue learning how to be married and not single, read all the books I have wanted to read outside of my textbook lists, practice drumming, maybe plant a garden, learn to roast coffee, and <em>write.</em> (I've been told at various points in my life, by varying individuals, in one form or another, that I should practice writing. Maybe I'll make money with it someday, or maybe I won't.)

In a nutshell, I'm going to do some things that I love and bring me joy, and practice some things that I love and should improve.  Will God take me back to school? Will he place me in local ministry? Maybe. I don't know. But one thing I know for sure: God tends to call me out of my comfort zone to discover the things I can do with his enablement, and to discover new things about myself. Until then, I wait, and enjoy this season of savoring life.

&nbsp;

<em>Questions and comments welcome, but I will moderate anything that could turn into an argument about women's roles in the church. Thank you. </em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I removed myself from all social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google Plus, Instagram) last Sunday. I don’t know when I’ll rejoin the party.

Removing myself was like going home after a huge party. As an introvert, there is only so much external (sometimes internal) mental stimulation I can take, and Facebook and Twitter were exhausting me, adding to my tendency for pessimism, which also tires me. It was like a party where I just sat and observed (or stood around with a drink in my hand, observing the mayhem and perhaps being approached sporadically by unsuspecting individuals) for hours on end, maybe making a comment here and there. Fellow introverts can understand the drain that these large gatherings have on the soul. The variety of social media, what with Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Instagram added to the mess of multitasking, which does not necessarily contribute to productivity.

So, for now, I am still blogging. But, although I will be happy to respond to blog comments, I won’t be participating in the chatter of social media at least until the end of the month. The freedom to think without other voices vying for my attention, to be able to focus on the present and on being present, is sweet.]]></content:encoded>
