The fireflies were like fairies  
They said to me,  
those little trail-side lanterns,
"Come, off the beaten path,  
down into the woods."  
I went, trotting down  
a few steps.  

I ventured partway.  
Curious & cautious steps I took,  
peering down the winding trail.  
I was ready for an adventure.  
But I am woman,  
it was getting dark,  
I was alone,  
I had nothing  
(except myself).  
And so I thought to myself,  
What if some creep is  
hiding amongst the thickness?  

And I retraced my steps  
back  
to the beaten path.
