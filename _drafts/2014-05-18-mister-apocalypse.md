There's a very interesting dude that C & I like to call "Mr. Apocalypse". The moniker came about because this guy is always ranting about Y2K and the end of the world. In a nutshell, he's a casually paranoid conspiracy theorist. He's also a frequent at the library, because he loves to play computer games.

One particular Saturday when I was working (it was just me and one other co-worker), our go-to, default public printer broke. At the same time, I was getting complaints about various individuals who could not access their games, because the city-wide web filter was blocking them.
