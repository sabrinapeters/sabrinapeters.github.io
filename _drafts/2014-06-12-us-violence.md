On {date}, Elliot Rodgers opened fire and killed {victims}.

On {date} {name} walked onto the campus of Seattle Pacific University.

Two days ago, {name} opened fire at RHS.

This MAP shows the number of school shootings since Sandy Hook.

"Heartbreaking" is putting it mildly, right?

Some well-meaning people point at the role of guns and say something like, "it's not a gun problem, it's a heart problem. If you take guns away, something else will be used to commit [insert grievous & violent act]. And even if legislations on guns got more strict, criminals still find ways around those laws. We need to be able to protect ourselves against criminals."

Okay, then.

But here's the problem: (well, first of all, what do you mean by "heart"?) It's NOT only a heart problem. It's not. This a consequence of a diseased system of thought(s), having become implanted in the gut of the US.

Sure, violence has been the first inclination of humanity since the Fall.

I also think about the fact that the US started in part thanks to rebels and guns. Guns represent a mark of liberty that USAmericans hold very dear. That's why the thought of restricting access to guns produces a great anxiety in many USAmerican citizens. But really, what are you most afraid of? Your American citizenship, or your Kingdom citizenship? They're not the same.

Never mind the strong culture of violence that is central in this country. Violent acts are seen as an answer to a multitude of problems, and are even portrayed in many recreational activities. I can think of a few off the top of my head: paintball, hockey, video games, boxing, films.

We could spend hours discussing the specific reasons behind the most recent violent acts. Misogyny, mental illness, patriarchy, racism. There are dozens of evil systems at play.

When it comes down to it, though, I think the problem is really an epidemic of fear.
