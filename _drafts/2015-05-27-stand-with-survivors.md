I had this long, self-deprecating diatribe written out, and decided to scrap it, because it was a bonafide s____y first draft, a la Anne Lamott. I went on and on about how astounding and outrageous it was (is!) that there are so many Christians out there defending the narrative given by abusers, rushing to “give grace” to them, and how I wanted nothing to do with those kinds of people. I ended with a small statement about letting victims have the platform and focus, which is exactly what I did NOT demonstrate.

Truth: I still want little to do with self-proclaiming Christians who defend abusers, and by proxy, any structures that help to produce an abuser. (You can learn more about one of them at http://www.quiverfull.com, if you can tolerate a poorly designed website. Cross-refence with [this guide](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/nolongerquivering/what-is-quiverfull/).)

Truth: I feel more like spewing curses these days than I ever have, due to feelings of anger at injustice. (See this [example.](http://www.carisadel.com/4009/christians-and-the-love-of-power/))

However, I do want to be more proactive in stepping out of the way, instead of publishing a story centered around myself. I don’t want to further a toxic, unsafe environment for survivors by clinging to the microphone. I want to learn to listen. As such, tomorrow I will be publishing an anonymous piece, written by a survivor. Stay tuned.
