Most people who call themselves writers are also avid readers. Sometimes I oscillate between reading and writing; that is, some weeks I read and read and read, and other weeks I write more than read. Some weeks are a mix of both; that would be a ideal, I think.

Last week I read a lot. Some fairly heavy events transpired last week, and my heart felt too heavy to write a cheerful post. There were deaths and news of more injustices committed by those in church leadership. Stuff like that just gets me down, and makes me want to escape into a good novel.
