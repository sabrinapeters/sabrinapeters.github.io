Most people who call themselves writers are also avid readers. Sometimes I oscillate between reading and writing; that is, some weeks I read and read and read, and other weeks I write more than read. Some weeks are a mix of both; that would be a ideal, I think.

Last week I read a lot. Some fairly heavy events transpired last week, and my heart felt too heavy to write a cheerful post; there were deaths and news of more injustices committed by those in church leadership. Stuff like that just gets me down, and makes me want to escape into a good novel, so I dove into [_Americanah_](http://www.amazon.com/Americanah-Chimamanda-Ngozi-Adichie/dp/0307455920/ref=sr_1_1_ha?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1401757221&sr=1-1&keywords=americanah).

That was the first work I've ever read by Adichie, and her talent as a writer was evident and undeniable. There's a lot going on in this book. There's discussion on African hair, Nigerian culture, British culture, and American culture. There are insights into immigration, racism, and gender roles. All of this is bookended by a love story stretching across time and continents.

I loved the way Adichie painted her characters. I could picture each one quite vividly
