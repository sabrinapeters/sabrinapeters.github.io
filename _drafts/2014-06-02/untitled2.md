It's easy to get cynical about the church these days (much less humanity!), and going to seminary didn't help any. So, word to the wise, if you have tendencies toward pessimism, don't go to seminary. Ahem. Moving on.

Suffice to say that my heart aches for anyone who has been under the influence of foolish church leaders, become led astray, and even abused by their leaders.
