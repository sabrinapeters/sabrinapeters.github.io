It's easy to get cynical about the church these days (much less humanity!), and going to seminary didn't help any. So, word to the wise, if you have tendencies toward pessimism, don't go to seminary. Ahem. Moving on.

Suffice to say that my heart aches for anyone who has been under the influence of foolish church leaders, become led astray, and even abused by their leaders. This has indubitably been the case at Mars Hill for many, and for quite a while now. I have been observing various threads discussing the latest news with some interest and sadness, and I have been thinking about what went wrong with Mars Hill Seattle for the past year.

Every time I observe a post on FB about Mars Hill and/or Mark Driscoll and the next thing he blew up or the next leader that MH has fired because of a power play, I notice a common reaction from those still active in a MH church, along these lines:

1) Don't slander!
2) Don't do this publicly!
3) Don't go by hearsay!

It does not matter who started which thread. I watched two unrelated MH threads explode with these same reactions from current members, and it told me one thing: group think. Which leads to the next question: whence comes group think?

That should be fairly easy to answer: manipulation and fear tactics. And whose fault would that be? Easy: leadership. Okay, but what's wrong with the leadership? Again, I've noticed similar themes in MH leadership.

1) Mark Driscoll, of course.
2) Fairly young leadership.
3) Male.
4)
