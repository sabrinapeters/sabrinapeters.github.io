I kinda said to myself that I wouldn’t write anymore reactionary posts, but the latest Challies post to ruffle some feathers has me thinking.

It has me pondering a) why I’m careful about the term sola scriptura and b) how many people actually believe (and feel horribly when it’s not working) that they must experience God only through scripture.

First, as much as I disagree with Challies on some issues, you gotta admire his consistency with his definition of sola scriptura, which, as far as I can tell, he derives from 1 Peter 1. I disagree with his interpretation, which is that the scriptures are sufficient for every part of life. They're not. You can't learn how to make cookies by reading the bible. You can't learn how to drive by reading the Bible, and you certainly can't provide good psychological counseling with just the Bible. Those are just a few hyperbolic examples.

Second, I’m careful with how I use the term *sola scriptura*. I like to use the term *prima scriptura*. That is, the scriptures are the primary authority. Experience is not wrong, but can be checked by the scriptures.

*Prima scriptura* still acknowledges the supremacy of Scripture. *I* acknowledge the supremacy of scripture, but I also acknowledge that mystical experiences are possible and not against Scripture. I firmly believe that our personalities wire us to commune with God in unique ways. If one is going to acknowledge how personalities shape an individual's approach to work, relationships, leaderships, and life, why wouldn't that relate to spirituality?

Some believers have mystical experiences. Some believers need a rosary or other prayer liturgies. Some believers feel closer to God in the forest, while others in an art gallery. Some believers prefer to write prayers. Some believers prefer spontaneous prayers. Some believers prefer to meditate on Scripture, while some prefer rigorous study (meditation is hard!). Point being, it makes me sad that Challies ignores the uniqueness of each person, insisting that Scripture-reading and prayer, as only defined in Scripture, are the only ways to commune with God.
