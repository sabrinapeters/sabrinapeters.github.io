I kinda said to myself that I wouldn’t write anymore reactionary posts, but the latest Challies post to ruffle some feathers has me thinking.

It has me wondering a) what is Challies’ Myers-Briggs? b) why I’m careful about the term sola scriptura and c) how many people actually believe (and feel horribly when it’s not working) that they must experience God only through scripture.

First, as much as I disagree with Challies on some issues, you gotta admire his consistency with his definition of sola scriptura, which, as far as I can tell, he derives from 1 Peter 1.

Second, that is why I’m careful with how I use sola scriptura.   I like to use the term prima scriptura, because, for example, I don’t think a mystical approach to God is sinful, and because I like to think that “experiencing God through scipture” is a misnomer in of itself. How can one experience (or, feel, is how I think Challies is using the word "experience"), a relationship with an author simply by reading his/her books?

Prima scriptura still acknowledges the supremacy of scripture. I acknowledge the supremacy of scripture, but I also acknowledge that mystical experiences are possible and not against scripture. I firmly believe that our personalities wire us to commune with God in unique ways. While Challies may stick to the Bible himself,
