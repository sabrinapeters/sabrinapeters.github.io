If I were a poet,  
I definitely wouldn't know it.
All I know is that I  
love to rhyme, apparently.  
And if I were honest,  
I don't even try enough; promise!  
I am too busy  
consuming words on printed pages  
to extend my own small phrases,  
because to consume things  
is a very American thing  
to do,  
is it not?
