Good morning, everyone!

Today I thought I'd share some images from this weekend, along with a few of my favorite/happy things.

On Saturday, after I supported some local farms (found eggs, strawberries, apples, and a lovely aloe vera plant!) we finally tried the Taco Shark truck. (I don't have any pictures, but feel free to find C's Intsagram feed for a beautiful capture of the best tacos we've had in a long, long, time.) After our tacos, we went back to the farmer's market for some flowers. Problem: we didn't have cash, and the lovely vendor didn't have a Square reader. Solution: C runs back up to our apartment to grab the two extra Square readers we had while I make a new friend, and in exchange she refuses to let us pay for the flowers. Win!

And, this Monday morning, here are a few of my favorite/happy things.

What brings you happiness?
