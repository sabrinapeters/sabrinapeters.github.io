<p>I got officially lost, for the first time, and skipped the first in this season of baby showers as a consequence.</p>
<p>Tried to articulate a book review onto digital paper, and failed (still in the works).</p>
<p>Dealt with fraud and won.</p>
<p>Have developed a loathing for craigslist.</p>
<p>Laughed at doofuses.</p>
<p>Cancelled my e-crapimony account.</p>
<p>Baked &amp; ate too many cookies (chocolate chip; vegan and gluten-free).</p>
<p>Blanked out on some basic chords during Sunday's worship service, and realized that I really do depend on green tea every a.m.</p>
<p>Took a break from computers for over 50 hours, and now find facebook and email to be quite tiring.</p>
<p>And I miss my MacBook. Â Very much.</p>
<p>How was your memorial weekend?</p>
