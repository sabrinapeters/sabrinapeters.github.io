<p>I don't remember ever touching on this subject before, but I think it needs addressing.</p>
<p>I’m a girl, in seminary.  What of it?</p>
<p>I’m in my mid-twenties, single, with hardly any “prospects in sight.”  What of it?</p>
<p>I love kids, and love discipling them.  What of it?  Does that mean I should be a mom?</p>
<p>Why do people seem to think that ________ would really, really profit from marriage?</p>
<p>Why can’t I hang out with a friend of the opposite gender without it having to be a “date”?</p>
<p>What are you people thinking?</p>
<p>No, I’m not angry.  I’m just very intrigued by this mindset, because it does not leave much room for creativity or imagination.</p>
<p>So what if I’m studying in seminary with a bunch of men and only a few other women?  Does that make me a little too weird?  What if I don’t manage to obtain that “MRS” degree by the time I graduate?  Does that mean something is wrong with me?</p>
<p>Come on.  Expand your one-track mind.</p>
<p>Just because you think I’m marriage material, or __________, or whatever, doesn’t mean I should be trying harder now that I’m halfway between 20 and 30.</p>
<p>And just because I hung with that person does not mean we went on a “date”.  Please use your imagination.  Can’t I be friends with those who are not girls?</p>
<p>I appreciate the freedom I have.  It is definitely a gift to make the most of.  And I admit, sometimes I wonder what marriage would be like, though in my mind, it does not outweigh being unattached. The closet romantic in me would scream in protest, saying,  isn’t love the most beautiful thing?  You tell me.</p>
<p>Don’t misunderstand me.  I’m not belittling marriage (it has great symbolic significance), although it would be nice to be reminded of its benefits, because I seem to have forgotten what people have tried to convince me of. I’m not saying that I would purposefully reject marriage (or a relationship) for no good reason.  I welcome whatever God has for me.  I want to go with the flow, which means not trying to swim ahead of things.  Don’t try to confuse me into thinking that marriage should be my goal in life, because it might cut off my grove.  I’m having a nice swim.</p>
