<p>I removed myself from all social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google Plus, Instagram) last Sunday. I don’t know when I’ll rejoin the party.</p>
<p>Removing myself was like going home after a huge party. As an introvert, there is only so much external (sometimes internal) mental stimulation I can take, and Facebook and Twitter were exhausting me, adding to my tendency for pessimism, which also tires me. It was like a party where I just sat and observed (or stood around with a drink in my hand, observing the mayhem and perhaps being approached sporadically by unsuspecting individuals) for hours on end, maybe making a comment here and there. Fellow introverts can understand the drain that these large gatherings have on the soul. The variety of social media, what with Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Instagram added to the mess of multitasking, which does not necessarily contribute to productivity.</p>
<p>So, for now, I am still blogging. But, although I will be happy to respond to blog comments, I won’t be participating in the chatter of social media at least until the end of the month. The freedom to think without other voices vying for my attention, to be able to focus on the present and on being present, is sweet.</p>
