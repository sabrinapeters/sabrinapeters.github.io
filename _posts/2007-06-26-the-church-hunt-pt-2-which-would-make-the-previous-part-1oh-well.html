<p>So, just to clarify some things for those who are wondering....</p>
<p>I wasn't thinking about attending the church where there is a husband-wife pastor-team.  I was just using three churches as an example of what kinds of things to look for in a church, and what kinds of things <span style="font-weight:bold;">not </span>to look for.  Sorry if I implied differently!</p>
<p>If things keep going the way they are, I'll probably stick with <a href="http://tacoma.somacommunities.org">Soma</a></p>
<p>I've been able to meet people and start building relationships.  I've also accidentally managed to volunteer service in the area of cleaning the church building..."accidentally", because I talked to the person in charge, but forgot to mention I was interested.  Next thing you know, she's calling me because I had expressed interest in helping!  Funny how God works.</p>
