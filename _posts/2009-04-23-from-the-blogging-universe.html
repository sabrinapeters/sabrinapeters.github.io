<p>I thought I'd put in a plug for some cool blogs on my blogroll.  If you are on my blogroll and don't see yourself on this list, it's not because I am a blog racist, it's because I have already put in a plug for you, or will highlight your blog...next time!  Unless you'd rather not, I suppose.  Shoot me an email if you'd have a problem with that.</p>
<p>But for now:</p>
<p><a href="http://adventuresinthearchetypes.blogspot.com/2009/04/am-i-rational.html">Am I Rational?</a> A cool new blog centered on theology and apologetics,<em> Adventures in the Archetypes</em>, asks if it is indeed rational to trust a trustworthy person.  Collie Coburn, a recent graduate from Wheaton (M.A., Historical and Systematic Theology), and Danny Marriott (graduate of San Diego Christian) contribute.</p>
<p>Nate Duriga, who is almost done at <a href="http://www.nbs.edu">Northwest Baptist Seminary</a> (I think) puts in a plug for us Bible nerds, as well as some pitfalls to having a seminary education at <a href="http://confusionatahigherlevel.blogspot.com">Impoverished Sage</a>.</p>
<p>I think my friend Brenda would like some interaction in this interesting discussion, <a href="http://kwihee.wordpress.com/2009/04/18/to-initiate-or-not-to-initiate-that-is-the-question/">"To Initiate or Not to Initiate?  That is the Question."</a></p>
<p>Matt Richey, another student (and graduate) of NBS, always likes to interact with and test traditionally held beliefs, and almost always has something thoughtful and articulate to share at <a href="http://faithforgedindoubt.blogspot.com/">Faith Forged in the Furnace of Doubt</a>.</p>
