<p>Just when I start to fall prey to the evils of selfishness (or, in reality, give in to the flesh) and dwelling only on what my mind is producing about myself....</p>
<p>...the Lord gives me a burden in the form of a lonely person who would seem to be ignored by general society, simply because she is different...</p>
<p>...I am not worthy.</p>
