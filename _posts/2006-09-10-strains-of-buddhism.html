<p>Does anyone know how to best witness to a Nichiren Buddhist?  I can clearly see (by what has been explained to me so far by a devotee of 50 years) that a huge problem is logic, and I can address those issues; however, I have almost no experience witnessing to followers of Eastern philosophy.  I'm think the best approach might be more philosophical in the beginning, and then pointing to scripture.</p>
<p>If anyone has any helpful input, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I've also been discovering that one does not need to go overseas to do cross-cultural missions.</p>
