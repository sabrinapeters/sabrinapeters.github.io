There's a very interesting dude that C & I like to call "Mr. Apocalypse". The moniker came about because this guy is always ranting about Y2K and the end of the world. One day when C was walking down the street, Mr. Apocalypse decides to get in his face and say loudly, "This weather is like the end of the world! The world's gonna end!" This guy is obsessed with a few computer games that he plays at the library, and I recently learned that he believes he is actually fighting crime through one of the games he plays.

One particular Saturday around lunchtime, when I was working (it was just me and one other co-worker), our go-to, default, public printer broke. At the same time, I was getting complaints from a few individuals who could not access their games, because the city's network-wide web filter was blocking them. I had two complaints from one individual, and then one complaint from Mr. Apocalypse, who leaves after making this issue known.

I file two help tickets with IT.

A couple of hours later, Mr. Apocalypse comes back and wants to try one of his other games on AdventureGames.com. A few minutes later, discovering another web filter block, Mr. Apocalypse becomes very distressed about having no games to play, and comes back up to me at the desk. He says, "I *need* to tell you something."

"Okay, what is it?"

Slightly wild-eyed, he says, "If these people do not have their games, I'm telling you, they will *RIOT*!!!"

"Sir, I understand this is upsetting, but there is nothing I can do immediately. This is a city-wide problem, not a library problem. All I can do is tell the IT department, and they can fix it Monday."

"Okay, well, you can tell them what I said if you think it will help. So do you think I can try Monday?"

I nod. "Yes, come back Monday."

With that, Mr. Apocalypse heads towards the exit.

Now, wouldn't *you* like to work with interesting people at the library?
