<p>Advent is here!!  I cannot express just how much I love this season; not because of the consumeristic Christmas that America celebrates, but because it's the beginning of a new church year, and it's the anticipation of the Savior's birth. It's my delight to share some Advent resources to assist you as you meditate upon this season.</p>
<p>(If you didn't read my thoughts on using disciplines of season, go <a href="http://pensamientosconfusos.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/the-discipline-of-seasons">here</a>.  For a introductory explanation of the church calendar, and an insight as to why I love following the liturgical calendar, Glenn Packiam has some thoughts <a href="http://glennpackiam.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/02/what-is-ash-wednesday-why-celebrate-lent.html.">here.</a>)</p>
<p>Note: this list is rather ecumenical, but that's not a bad thing!  I encourage you to see what other resources you can use beside your usual stand-bys.  You might be surprised at the treasures you find.</p>
<p>Let me share with you a couple of links directly related to Advent that I wish I could've written, myself.  Glenn Packiam has written <a href="http://glennpackiam.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/11/how-advent-can-be-much-more-than-the-christmas-season.html?fb_action_ids=10200220009201665&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=aggregation&amp;fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582">here</a> about taking the time and space to make Advent about more than just Christmas, and has some Advent resources <a href="http://glennpackiam.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/11/advent-resources.html">here</a> to assist you in reflecting upon this season.</p>
<p>Word of Life Church has constructed an Advent reading guide, which you can find <a href="http://wolc.com/blog/2012/11/advent-scripture-reading-guide/">here</a>.</p>
<p>John Piper is giving away a free eBook called <em>Good News of Great Joy </em><a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/good-news-of-great-joy-free-advent-ebook">here</a>.</p>
<p>Ann Voskamp is giving away a Jesse Tree Advent Devotional <a href="http://www.aholyexperience.com/2010/11/free-jesse-tree-advent-devotional-book/">here</a>.</p>
<p>For more of a somber perspective of Christmas, see Dr. Varner's post <a href="http://dribex.tumblr.com/post/36958073142">here</a>, giving an overview of <em>A Not So Silent Night</em>.  Dr. V will be sharing about Christmas devotionals throughout the season, so make you sure you re-visit his blog.</p>
<p>Christine Sine has a wonderful list of Advent resources on her <a href="http://godspace.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/resources-for-advent/">blog</a>, and created a Facebook event page for Advent resources that she updates weekly: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/284602891643311/">Join Us for Advent. </a></p>
<p>The Jesuit Post has a short, but rich and eclectic list of Advent resources on their <a href="http://thejesuitpost.org/site/2012/12/making-a-list-checking-it-all-through-advent/">blog</a>.</p>
