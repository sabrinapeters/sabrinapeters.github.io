<p>A year ago, I was busily preparing myself for seminary, as I began to develop a plan for my life:</p>
<p>-Finish grad school with an MDiv.</p>
<p>-Become TESOL certified.</p>
<p>-Teach English to speakers of other languages until my loans were paid off.</p>
<p>-Teach and church-plant and disciple, etc. in some foreign country until I died.</p>
<p>(what about marriage?  you ask.  oh yeah, maybe that too.)</p>
<p>Two months ago, I was wrapping up my first quarter at seminary, feeling quite exhausted.<br />
Two weeks into the second quarter, illness hits.<br />
That was over three weeks ago, and I have not been to class since.<br />
I hesitate to say what Iâ€™m gonna do next.  Only God knows.</p>
