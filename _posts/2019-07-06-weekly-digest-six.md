Hello friends, and welcome to Sabrina's Weekly Digest No. 6. I've been on the struggle bus the past few weeks in more than one way, which is why this is a day late. This one is going to be short and sweet, so enjoy! Find last week's digest [here](https://sdrp.me/2019/06/28/weekly-digest-five/).

### Listening

#### Podcasts

One of my Twitter friends reminded me that Esther Perel has a [podcast](https://www.estherperel.com/podcast). She's a couple's therapist and author, and these podcast episodes are anonymous recordings of different client sessions. I've listened to two so far while at the gym. As a partnered individual, I find this podcast very relatable and insightful, but, these sessions have things to teach almost anyone, about themselves and/or relationships in general.

#### Music

I wrote a few weeks ago that I listened to Lizzo's newest album and it was just OK. I re-listened yesterday and wondered what kind of mood I was in when I first listened, because I was really enjoying myself. The beats are catchy, and she sings from a place of freedom.

### Reading

#### Books

##### Recently finished

[*Vox*](https://g.co/kgs/3ktLco) I'd call this *The Handmaid's Tale Lite*. It's not very well written, albeit suspenseful. This is a theocratic dystopia where women are only allowed to use 100 words per day, and the counter around their wrist tracks the number, issuing electric shocks if that number is greater than 100.

[*Sabrina and Corina*](https://g.co/kgs/2HhDS8) I finally got this back from the library, and finished the last couple of short stories. I'm sticking with my original assessment, which can be found [here](https://sdrp.me/2019/06/07/weekly-digest-two/). It's one of the few times I've given a piece of contemporary fiction five stars.

[*Evangelical Theology*](https://books.google.com/books/about/Evangelical_Theology.html?id=8iQgolN1WTMC) This started out somewhat dense, but I eventually grew accustomed to Barth's manner of speaking (these are transcribed lectures), and even read out of amusement for his grumpy tone and taking shots at people like Tillich or Bultmann. It's a great introduction to Barth.

### Watching

For some reason, I decided to re-watch the last few episodes of *Grantchester* season 3. When I first discovered *Grantchester* and *Father Brown*, I was sold on the whole detective/priest bi-vocational gig, and still am. Maybe I should look into getting a PI license? Kidding...sort of.

*Spider-Man: Far From Home* was our July 4th viewing event, and it didn't disappoint. It was the type of fun I expected. The first half is not as good as the second half, but the post-credits scene was quite surprising. In my opinion, since this is apparently a thing: Jake Gyllenhaal did not get better with age.

That's all for now! Hopefully I'll have a non-digest blog post up next week.
