<p>Okay Bible nerds.</p>
<p>I know there aren't many of you who actually read my blog, because my posts are not that Biblically nerdy, but, I know there are a handful of you.</p>
<p>I need help in deciding which Bible software to invest in (in the next year or so).  Now that Logos has a version for Mac, I'm leaning toward them, but I hear that Accordance is also good stuff.  I will be using it mainly for the language tools.</p>
<p>Input invited and appreciated.  :)</p>
