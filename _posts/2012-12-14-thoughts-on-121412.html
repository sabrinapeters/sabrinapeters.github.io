<p>Today is not the day for problem-solvers to get into debates about causes and solutions.  I understand that people grieve in certain ways, but, debates are the absolute<em> last thing</em> that grieving families, whose hearts are screaming out against evil and injustice, who are crying in pain, want to hear, and need to hear.  They don't want solutions; they want and need love and compassion.  They don't need to hear about gun-control, or stronger security measures; they need emotional, physical, spiritual, and psychological support.  While problem-solving has an appropriate time and place, its time is not now.</p>
<p>So, for the love of God and love of neighbor, mourn with those who mourn.  </p>
<p>Love.  Pray.  Listen.  Pass the peace. </p>
<p>The LORD is near to the brokenhearted, and saves the crushed in spirit.</p>
<p> </p>
