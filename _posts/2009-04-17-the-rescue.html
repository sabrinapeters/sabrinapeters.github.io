<p>At this very moment I am wearing a t-shirt on which there is a depiction of an ak-47.  Go <a href="http://www.invisiblechildren.com">here</a> to acquaint yourself with the what, why, and how.</p>
<p>My friend Rachel, has been wearing the same shirt, along with another one that says "I heart the LRA", all month (and has been wearing only those two shirts the entire month of April...I just happened to receive mine a bit belatedly). Here is her commentary on the experience of wearing only two shirts for a month:  <a href="http://rachelreveries.wordpress.com/2009/04/17/mankey-shirt/">Mankey Shirt</a>.</p>
<p>Please, if you are not doing anything on April 25th, find the nearest location to you and participate in The Rescue.</p>
