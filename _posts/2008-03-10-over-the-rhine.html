<p><span style="font-family:lucida grande;">"Jesus in New Orleans"</span></p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">The last time I saw Jesus<br />
I was drinking bloody mary's in the South<br />
In a barroom in New Orleans<br />
Rinsin' out the bad taste in my mouth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">She wore a dark and faded blazer<br />
With a little of the lining hanging out<br />
When the jukebox played Miss Dorothy Moore<br />
I knew that it was him without a doubt</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">I said the road is my redeemer<br />
I never know just what on earth I'll find<br />
In the faces of a stranger<br />
In the dark and weary corners of a mind</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">She said, The last highway is only<br />
As far away as you are from yourself<br />
And no matter just how bad it gets<br />
It does no good to blame somebody else</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">Ain't it crazy<br />
What's revealed when you're not looking all that close<br />
Ain't it crazy<br />
How we put to death the ones we need the most</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">I know I'm not a martyr<br />
I've never died for anyone but me<br />
The last frontier is only<br />
The stranger in the mirror that I see</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;">But when I least expect it<br />
Here and there I see my savior's face<br />
He's still my favorite loser<br />
Falling for the entire human race</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;font-size:78%;"><span style="font-size:100%;">-Ohio</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:lucida grande;"><br />
</span></p>
