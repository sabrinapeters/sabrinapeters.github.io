<p>I will be the first to say I'm not a girly girl, even though I may look like one.  Here are some tip-offs:</p>
<p>1) I don't like to shop.  That's practically female treason.  Well, I like to shop for books - that's a given.  What kind of nerd would I be if I didn't like to peruse bookshops?<br />
2) I own only a few pieces of clothing that have feminine prints (i.e., flowers or lacy things) on them, and I hardly ever wear them.<br />
3) Facebook said I was 0% girly.  Okay, maybe that's slightly fallacious (very fallacious) quiz, but still.<br />
4) I detest wearing heels.  I'm a komplete kween of klutziness when I wear them, and they hurt.<br />
5) I'd rather not carry a purse.  A book bag will suffice, or nothing.  Nothing's good.  Because I usually carry enough to fit in my hands or pockets, or a load of books.<br />
6) I am not a fan of diamonds.  Oy!  Sorry, that was probably harsh sounding to some of your ears.<br />
7) I've only perused <a href="http://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a> one or two times, mainly because a friend had started one up.  And boy oh boy, I was sorely unaware that so many people (probably females) use Etsy, until Sunday.  I guess you're not a girly girl unless you shop Etsy.  ;-)</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon there was hosted a lovely Blogger's Lunch, in the L.A. area, by <a href="http://notesfromdionne.blogspot.com">Dionne</a>.  I think everyone of the girl bloggers (in cluding Dionne and <a href="http://piggyinthepuddle.blogspot.com">Lindsey</a>) has an Etsy page except for me and <a href="http://maggisaar.blogspot.com">Maggi</a>, who is considering setting one up because she makes these fab purses, and <a href="http://bethanymurphy.net/">Bethany</a> (okay, so that's only half of the us female bloggers...I guess Etsy is kinda overwhelming ;-) ).  And not only that, but each of the girl bloggers got a little gift basket chockfull of gifts from insanely creative Etsy sponsors, <a href="http://ohhellofriend.blogspot.com">Danni</a> one of them.  There were many squeals and exclamations of gratitude and delight at the discovery of the little things within that basket.  I have to admit, the stuff is cute, and I do like wearing earrings and rings, which everyone scored in their baskets.  Oh, and Danni also won the door prize, which <em>also</em> produced delighted squeals.   I get tired of squealing and exclaiming so much, so you didn't hear any squeals from me.  Fortunately, none of the guys like <a href="http://pasadenawhereyouat.blogspot.com">Eric </a>or <a href="http://trendell.blogspot.com">Andrew</a> or <a href="http://circumstances4clappinghands.blogspot.com">Jon</a> (who just got a blog yesterday) or Evan or Nick were squealing or exclaiming, so I was in good company.</p>
<p>I'm not going to summarize the Bloggers' Luncheon on here, because Maggi, Lindsey, and Dionne all have nice summaries and sweet (and silly) photos on their blogs.  Check 'em out, and check out some of the cool Etsy shops, if you're into that.  I will probably explore Etsy a bit more when I secure a real job.</p>
<p>Thanks to Dionne for helping me connect with my girly side.  I think there is one on me, somewhere.</p>
