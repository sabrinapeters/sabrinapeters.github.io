Hello, my friends. It's been a month since I've posted anything. It's also been A MONTH, and it has either cumulated or resulted in a depressive-smelling funk I haven't been able to pull myself out of. You know a bookworm is depressed when they don't even feel like reading, and, for me, don't feel like writing. You know, too, that your nerd brain is worn out when you don't even want to listen to podcasts.

I think job hunting might not help in this situation, but I am happy to report that after revising my resume and applying to different jobs, I have at least one in-person interview next week, and had a phone interview yesterday.

Today, my brain is very foggy and it is taking much effort to string words together, so, this will be short and sweet.

### Listening

#### Podcasts

Yesterday, on my way to get some medical imaging done, I decided on listening to Lisa DeLay's podcast where she talks to Karen Gonzalez about immigrants and the Bible. I haven't finished it yet, but I was really gaining insight from their conversation about Karen's book, [_The God Who Sees_](https://g.co/kgs/vR5mbZ). Check the podcast [here](https://lisadelay.com/blog/spark-muse-podcast/). By the way, God loves and welcomes all immigrants, undocumented or not.

#### Music

On the airplane, I like to listen to calming music because I almost always have some level of anxiety by the time I get to my seat. Flying back to Seattle from Pennsylvania this week (which, if you had had a cancellation, three delays, and another rescheduled flight, you might have been anxious, too), I listened to Audrey Assad's [_Evergreen_](https://open.spotify.com/album/2jevkGpoYaQv6Iu9aLU8nl?si=IbRnBf_LQUC1xvMu0E-5KQ), and Fabrizio Paterlini's [_The Art of the Piano_](https://open.spotify.com/album/46zD64mG9wIYylzJaMqpHV?si=jjfTxfJFSIyqYuIYX6gsWw). I highly recommend both as soundtracks to meditating or catnapping, as well as soothing nerves.

### Reading

I'm just going to share some articles I've found interesting lately. 

- [_The Catholic Case for Communism_](https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2019/07/23/catholic-case-communism) I thought this was a well-written piece by one of the hosts of _The Magnificast_, Dean Detloff. However, many, many traditional Catholics did not agree with me or Dean, and the Twitter thread under the tweet of this article (from publication, not from me) had some of the nastiest attitudes I'd ever seen from people who associate themselves with Christianity. They'd even rival some Evangelical fundies. 

- [_Donald Trump and Militant Evangelical Masculinity_](https://religionandpolitics.org/2017/01/17/donald-trump-and-militant-evangelical-masculinity/). This one is a couple years old, and I don't remember seeing it before. It is a slightly different angle on the Evangelical/Trump relationship: the problem of essentialized gender roles.

### Watching

I just finished _Stranger Things_ Season 3. I don't really have much to say other than, I will be kind of angry if they make El a villain next.
