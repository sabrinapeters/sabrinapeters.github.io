<p>The number of things that have had to be repaired in ze auto this year: about six.</p>
<p>The number of people who have gotten engaged/married this year: I've lost track.</p>
<p>The number of times I've injured myself in the past twelve months: three. That's a record.</p>
<p>Out of those three injuries, the number of times I've injured my feet: twice.  Right foot, inside metatarsal tendon.  Left foot, outside metatarsal tendon.  What are the odds?  (Well, with my royal clumsiness, really high, actually.)</p>
<p>The number of times I've had to speak with B of A this year: twice too many.  (Time to switch.)</p>
<p>The number of times I've eaten a bowl of popcorn for dinner in the past ten months: umm.......???</p>
<p>The number of books I've gotten for free the past ten months: maybe twenty?</p>
<p>The number of books I've touched in the past ten months: I'm guessing around ninety thousand, give or take a little.</p>
<p>The number of cookies I've eaten: a lady never tells.</p>
<p>The number of pages I've read in the past year: sorry, lost track.</p>
<p>The number of Lara bars I've consumed the past year: around two hundred and fifty.</p>
<p>The number of poems I've composed this year: too few.</p>
<p>The number of stories I've written in the past few years: [blank]</p>
<p>The number of babies that have greeted this evil world in 2010 or will be before the year has past: that I know of?  About fourteen, at least.</p>
<p>The number of times I've tallied stuff like this to a T: never.  I haven't even given you numbers for everything.</p>
<p>Happy summer!</p>
