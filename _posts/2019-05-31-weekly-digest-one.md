Hello, and welcome to the first installment of Sabrina‚Äôs Weekly Digest, where I share some interesting things I‚Äôve encountered. Essentially, these are things I think you might like to know.

# Listening

## Podcasts

If you haven‚Äôt heard, I was recently on a podcast episode of Sancta Colloquia, where I talked with Rev. Lauren Larkin about _Our God Loves Justice_. You can find more information [here](https://sdrp.me/2019/05/26/my-first-podcast/).

Other podcast episodes I‚Äôve enjoyed recently: The Magnificast‚Äôs episode [Capitalism, Socialism, and Communism 101!](https://soundcloud.com/themagnificast/ep-103-capitalism-socialism-and-communism-101), and Theology and Socialism‚Äôs episode [Socialism and Orthodoxy](http://theologyandsocialism.libsyn.com/socialism-and-orthodoxy).

On Twitter this week, someone recently tweeted, ‚ÄúWhy are there so many theology podcasts with white dudes based on beer?‚Äù to which I replied, ‚Äú‚Äùwhy are so many theology podcasts just white dudes? they get old really fast.‚Äù The original tweeter said he was joking, but I wasn‚Äôt, haha.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So, the tweet I was responding to here turned out to be a joke, but...this is not a joke, so in my digest this week I will be including a list of podcasts NOT hosted by just white dudes. FYI. <a href="https://t.co/uemHR2SAhx">https://t.co/uemHR2SAhx</a></p>&mdash; sabrina üáµüá∑ (@sdrp_) <a href="https://twitter.com/sdrp_/status/1133890156832759810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I wanted to do more than complain, so here is a list of podcasts that are NOT hosted by two white dudes. They are mostly theological/spiritually oriented, although not exclusively so. They are linked to their Twitter account, or website if the podcast doesn‚Äôt have a Twitter account. They are in no particular order. If you have any other ones to add, put them in the comments so I can add them the list!

# Reading

## Books:

Here are some books I recently finished, along with some brief thoughts:
 _Union Made_ [review](https://sdrp.me/2019/05/30/union-made/)
 _She Who Would be King_(https://g.co/kgs/P99UjK): beautifully written historical novel with magical elements.
 Captain America Vol.1: Winter in America (https://g.co/kgs/bgNcKD): I enjoyed this, including the illustrations,  but it was fairly predictable.
 Captain Marvel, Earth‚Äôs Mightiest Hero, Vol. 2 (https://www.marvel.com/comics/collection/58348/captain_marvel_earths_mightiest_hero_vol_2_trade_paperback): less predictable than Captain America, plus I always enjoy Captain Marvel more than Captain America, but I am not a fan of the illustration style that makes long, thin characters.

## Articles and miscellanea:

I haven‚Äôt read this yet, but it looks to be an enlightening read, from the hosts of The Magnificast: [‚ÄúPodcasting Pedagogy, and the Inheritance of Clandestine Broadcasts.‚Äù](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:24519/)

# Curiosities

A couple weeks ago, in the adult confirmation class, the rector at the church I‚Äôm attending said some things about Jesus I‚Äôd never heard before, not even in the classes I took with a professor from Claremont School of Theology (being a good fundie kid, I thought she was off her rocker, but I learned the stuff she taught so I could ace the exams):

* Scholars say Jesus never worked as a craftsman, but only as a Rabbi, for which he was formally educated.
* Joseph, Mary, and Jesus lived in Alexandria, Egypt.
* Mary‚Äôs parents, Joachim and Anna, both received angelic visitations about Mary‚Äôs birth, and Joseph was a much older cousin with children of his own already (the part about his having children I‚Äôve heard speculated before).

Being naturally skeptical, I went to the university library near the gentrified palace where I live, and surveyed over half a dozen works on Christ dealing with his life (Meiers ended up being the most helpful), but nowhere could I substantiate the claim that Jesus never worked a trade and was only a known Rabbi. I did, however, renew my acquaintance with the Apocryphal Gospels, and that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find the accounts of Joachim and Anna, and Mary‚Äôs life at the Temple. If you‚Äôre curious to read for yourself, here are the names of the two accounts I read most thoroughly: Proto-Gospel of James, Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew. A good source for reading those is [ _The Apocryphal Gospels_](https://g.co/kgs/KdS3CP), which is a Greek/English parallel, with  some background notes I found helpful.

And that concludes my first weekly digest! Let me know if you'd like to see anything in particular.
