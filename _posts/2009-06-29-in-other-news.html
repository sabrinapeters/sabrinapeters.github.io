<p>...I'm applying for re-admission to <a href="http://www.nbs.edu">NBS</a> for the continuation of the <a href="http://www.nbs.edu/index.php?nid=67653&amp;s=mn">Master of Divinity</a> program there.  Hopefully I'll be able to make my way back up to Washington State before the year is up, but I have a feeling I'll end up there one way or another.  An omen?  Maybe.  Not going to say one way or another.</p>
<p>Speaking of omens, you should read <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(novel)">The Alchemist </a></em>(Paulo Coelho) for an interesting tale of destiny, fate, and omens.  It's short, and if you like a good philosophical novel, you will not be disappointed.  There are some things to ponder, and some other things that are simply not true, but, hey, it's a novel.  Whaddya expect?  It's an enjoyable read, so go read it.</p>
