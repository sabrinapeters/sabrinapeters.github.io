<p>Recently I read a post by Tim Challies on mysticism, interacting with a paper Dr. Whitney presented at an ETS meeting several years back. Challies argues that mysticism is outside of the boundaries of evangelicalism, because those boundaries go beyond the text of Scripture. The only experiences of God that are valid then, must be validated by what scripture says about God and how believers in scripture experienced him.</p>
<p>And then I think to myself, I must not be evangelical.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I wholeheartedly support the use of different spiritual disciplines that are not found recorded in the Bible, based on this premise: not one individual is like the other.</p>
<p>Everyone has been created with different personalities, physical traits, skills, talents, abilities, gifts, and so the list goes on. You won't find two individuals who are exactly alike. They may be close, but not completely identical. Moreso, because everybody is different, we relate differently to people. If we can relate so differently to people, even differently to each person we meet, how is it that we are restricted in our experiences and relation to God based on what scripture records? Yes, we read scripture and pray, and should always, but the ways in which we pray and read scripture and experience God vary from individual to individual. God created personality and individuality, and it matters in relationship to him.</p>
