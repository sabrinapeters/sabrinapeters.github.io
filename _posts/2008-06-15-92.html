<p>i didn't realize how anti-cultural (is that a word?  probably not) it would be to go without my car.   it's a whole new world.</p>
<p>it's too easy to ignore what society considers the lowly by just zipping around,<br />
minding one's own business,<br />
riding inside a bubble,<br />
feeling oh-so-safe.</p>
<p>i don't think i've been asked for money more in my life than in the past 2 weeks.  i don't think i've seen more pain and poverty, whether self-inflicted or other-inflicted, whether living on the street or off the street, whether verbalized or not.</p>
<p>not only do automobiles contribute to laziness, but they also contribute to the freakin' individualism we westerners are too familiar with.<br />
(wait a second, no, not the automobiles.<br />
it's the fact that people drive 'em.)</p>
<p>we're called to help the hurting, but how can we help those whom we can't even see?  pay attention, people.  i'm going to try harder.</p>
