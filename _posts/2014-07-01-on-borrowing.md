Everybody knows I love libraries - hey, that's why I'm even working in one! But there are some books that just can't be borrowed well, and poetry is one.

from now until forever and ever  
i will not borrow those  
poetry books  
because  
poetry books  
are meant to be savored  
like delicious dark chocolate, forever and ever
