<p><span style="font-size:85%;">“We rush in, being very, very pleased, it would seem at times, to find other<br />
men’s mistakes.  We build ourselves up by tearing other men down…we love the<br />
smell of blood, the smell of the arena, the smell of the bullfight”</span></p>
<p>-Schaeffer</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is true.  Pride is nasty beyond description.</p>
