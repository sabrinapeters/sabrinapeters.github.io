¬°Hola, amigos! This week's digest will be very short. I've said that before, I know, but this one will be the briefest of them all.

(I apologize that there was no "Sunday Reflections" for this week; I stayed home from church feeling rather unwell.)

Let's try a different order this time, shall we?

## Reading

### Books
I finally got through the halfway mark in *The People's History of the United States*! I only started this book almost five years ago; when C noticed I was getting really upset every time I read it, he suggested I take a break. It was a fairly long break, and I figured that this history book couldn't be more upsetting than current events, so I've been slowly making my way through again. I made it through the Spanish-American War, the establishment of the IWW (Wobblies: Industrial Workers of the World) and the fight for unions and labor regulations, and am just starting on the World War I chapter.

It feels weird just reading one book right now, so I'll probably pick up another book this weekend.

### Articles and miscellanea

I found this interesting article on ++Rowan Williams last week and forgot to share: ["The Velvet Reformation"](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/03/the-velvet-reformation/307292/?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share)

For some reason, I forgot that this month has been Native American Heritage Month. Let me suggest that you look at Rebecca Nagle's Twitter thread(s) for a little bit of learning with me on that front:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NativeAmericanHeritageMonth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NativeAmericanHeritageMonth</a>.

## Listening

So, uh...I haven't listened to any podcast episodes this week, but I HAVE been busy with planning my own podcast(!!!). I've almost got a name for it, but the concept is this: an episode of 30 minutes or less, where I invite an expert in an area of religious studies (most likely Christianity) to explain their niche with as little jargon as possible. It's a theology podcast of sorts for the masses. I hope to get it running in January! 

## Watching

I finished *Fleabag*, and I don't think I've enjoyed it as much as a lot of people have. I found *Criminal* series' in French, German, and Spanish, so I think I'll watch those next. Do you have any suggestions for international films? Let me know!

Told you this would be short!
