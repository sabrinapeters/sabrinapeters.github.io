<p>1)  <strong>Blog spammers</strong>, flip off and stay away!</p>
<p>2) <strong>Weird automated tweeple</strong>, go and stay away!</p>
<p>3)  <strong>Tweeple whores</strong>, stop stalking me!</p>
<p>4) <strong> Craigslist scammers</strong>, stop preying on poor, unemployed people!!</p>
<p>5) <strong>Inspiration, </strong>I had you the other day.  What happened?  What did I do wrong?  <em>Come back!</em></p>
<p>That's all.  Is that too much to ask?</p>
