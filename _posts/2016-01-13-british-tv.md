I got hooked on _[Jessica Jones]_(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2357547/) over break, after I rewatched _Sherlock (BBC)_ for the fourth time. After I finished watching it, I scrolled through Netflix's British TV recommendations, and noticed _[Broadchurch]_(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2249364/) (probably because of the David Tennant connection!). I thought, Eh, why not, and pretty much couldn't quit until I finished.

I'm a sucker for a good story; once immersed into the plot, through page or screen, I have trouble emerging until its conclusion. I've noticed lately that British television has been a lot more appealing to me lately than good ol' American television, so I started making a list of reasons why.

(Note: I don't pretend to be a screen critic, so this is not very explicative by any means. Even pretending to would mean ditching life as I currently know it, in order to watch and rewatch films and shows so I could write about them, and who would want that? [Who am I kidding - that sounds awesome!])

Here's my list, in no particular order, with a few short explanations.

1) _Pride & Prejudice_ (the Colin Firth version, duh)
2) _Broadchurch_ (I almost got emotional at the end of season two, because the tone of redemption was so strong.)
3) _Sherlock_ (did you catch the New Year's special? That was a fun ride, and brilliantly done. Simply brilliant.)
4) _Downton Abbey_ (To me, this is a light soap opera, but that doesn't stop me from watching!)
5) _Doc Martin_
6) _Black Mirror_ (I will acknowledge this is great television, but I hate feeling so existential when I watch it.)
7) Rich character development - this has been especially noticeable in _Broadchurch_, since it was a crucial part of the story.
8) The actors in British television seem more realistic to me. American television tends to use actors that are above average in looks, and many times on the thin side. Actors don't need to look like models.
9) Scenic settings - I think this mostly refers to _Doc Martin_ and _Broadchurch_. Who wouldn't want to be living in a little, seaside town?
10) Vocabulary - this is kind of a silly thing to note, but I like that British has a wider variety of slang. I get tired of hearing the same American idioms (and curse words).
11) Dry humor - c.f. _Sherlock_.
