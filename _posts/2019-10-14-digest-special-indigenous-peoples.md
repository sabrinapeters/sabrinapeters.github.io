It's only been two months since my last digest, hurray! /sarcasm

Last year on what has been known as Columbus Day, and what is now Indigenous Peoples' Day, I created a short Twitter moment about the Taino, who were the first inhabitants of Puerto Rico. I've decided to add all of those links to a more permanent and easily found space, plus some new ones I've come across this year.

For my previous digest, go [here](https://sdrp.me/2019/08/17/weekly-digest-eight/). For my last Puerto Rico themed digest, go [here](https://sdrp.me/2019/07/19/weekly-digest-seven/).

Who were the Taino? 
- If you're feeling ambitious, take a look at this genetic study: ["Origins and genetic legacies of the Caribbean Taino"](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/10/2341). 
- For a longer historical narrative, [read this one: "Taino History Puerto Rico"](http://puertoricorevealed.com/taino-history-puerto-rico/). 

What did Columbus orchestrate when he encountered the Taino? 
- A very short summary from [Yale Genocide Studies](https://gsp.yale.edu/case-studies/colonial-genocides-project/puerto-rico) alludes to Columbus' impact.
- Here's a summary of Columbus' encounter with island natives in general: ["Here’s the real story of Columbus that people prefer to ignore"](https://grist.org/politics/heres-the-real-story-of-columbus-that-people-prefer-to-ignore/amp/?__twitter_impression=true).
- *Smithsonian Magazine* published an excellent article exploring Taino heritage in 2011. If you can't read anything else, [read this one: "What Became of the Taíno?"](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/what-became-of-the-taino-73824867/).

Where are the Taino now? 
- From *National Geographic*: ["Meet the survivors of a ‘paper genocide’"](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2019/10/meet-survivors-taino-tribe-paper-genocide/?cmpid=org=ngp::mc=social::src=twitter::cmp=editorial::add=tw20191014hist-tainopapergenocide::rid&sf221441283=1)
- From *The Atlantic*: ["How Ancient DNA Can Help Recast Colonial History"](https://amp-theatlantic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/598246/?usqp=mq331AQCKAE%3D&amp_js_v=0.1#aoh=15710754665399&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fscience%2Farchive%2F2019%2F09%2Fwhat-ancient-dna-says-about-puerto-ricos-history%2F598246%2F)
- Last, but not least, some interesting historical and archaeological/anthropological developments: [ "Dismissed as fakes for a century, enigmatic Puerto Rican stones could rewrite history"](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/article235714732.html).
