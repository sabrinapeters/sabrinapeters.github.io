<p>...certain "christian" bookstores are "christian" in name only.  and why everything is about money.</p>
<p>take a look at this t-shirt.</p>
<p>it is due to come out in my work's latest sale catalog.</p>
<p>last night, at the latest staff meeting, my boss announced that everything in the catalog had been ordered, except for this shirt.</p>
<p>the reason?  she was "offended" by the image of jesus on a cross, spilling out blood and gore.  she wasn't going to order it, unless someone specially requested it.</p>
<p>now, i know that my boss does not want to be associated with some catholics who <span style="font-style:italic;">may </span>take crucifixes a bit too far, but to throw out the atonement is to throw out the gospel.  jesus died on a cross to bear the wrath you and i deserved.  and you are offended at the sight?   god help us.</p>
<p>i do not work at a "christian" bookstore.  i knew that before, but it is becoming more and more evident even to those who thought a christian bookstore (a "christian" <span style="font-style:italic;">anything</span>) on this planet even existed.  i work at a bookstore.  just a bookstore owned by people with christian morals, fighting for moral lifestyles, and nothing more.  it is no more sacred than borders.</p>
