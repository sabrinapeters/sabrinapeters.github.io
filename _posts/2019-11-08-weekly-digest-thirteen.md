Greetings, fellow sojourners. It's been a fairly busy week for me away from my computer screen, so this is really only the second day I've sat myself down to write. Monday I spent writing; Tuesday I spent mostly proofreading and editing. You can read that work [here](https://sdrp.me/2019/11/05/sunday-reflection-two/).

## Listening

### Music

Last week, I asked for music suggestions, because nothing in my usual rotation had been very appealing lately. Here are the artists that were recommended:

- *The Synaptik*
- *Charlotte Day Wilson*
- *Big Thief*
- *Angel Olsen*

I didn't get around to *Angel Olsen* yet, but *Big Thief* and *Charlotte Day Wilson* are good choices if you like singer/songwriter stuff. *The Synaptik* I found to be great to listen to while writing; I've been told it's "mumble rap", and I don't know any Arabic, so while I don't understand the lyrics, I still thought it enjoyable to listen to.

### Podcasts

I was delighted that *Sancta Colloquia* has a new episode to listen to! It is one of my favorite podcasts, and not just because I got to talk on one episode. I like to think of this new episode as a conversation between dialectical and apocalyptic theology (well, considering the theologians in dialogue, it quite literally is!) and how theology can speak to the nitty gritty. Listen: ["Militant Grace"](https://t.co/uBFz2fSVuh?amp=1)

And, one of my other frequently consumed podcasts, *Faith and Capital*, did an episode featuring Puerto Rico. In this [episode](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/faith-and-capital), Chase interviews the host of [*Puerto Rico Forward*](http://www.puertoricoforward.com), Andrew Mercado-Vazquez, to explore how capitalism and imperialism intersect in la isla's colonial status. Take a listen, check out Andrew's podcast, and if you haven't already done so, check out the brief recommendations I gave in my [seventh digest](https://sdrp.me/2019/07/19/weekly-digest-seven/) about Puerto Rico.

## Reading

### Books

I finally finished [_The Water Dancer_](https://g.co/kgs/ehqRrZ). I still recommend it; in fact, I gave it 5 stars on Goodreads, which is something I rarely do. It is historical fiction and fantasy, and quintessential Ta-Nehisi Coates. If you've read any of his other works, you probably know what I'm talking about. The story is based on [William and Peter Still](https://www.pbs.org/black-culture/shows/list/underground-railroad/stories-freedom/peter-stills-story/).

### Articles and miscellanea

I really resonated with this piece on language and identity: ["Moses Speaks Spanglish"](https://therevealer.org/moses-speaks-spanglish/)

Here's a brief summary of how trauma studies are interacting with theological studies: ["How Christian theology and practice are being shaped by trauma studies"](https://www.christiancentury.org/article/critical-essay/how-christian-theology-and-practice-are-being-shaped-trauma-studies?fbclid=IwAR38mUIu71gMoYXW8omeD4mjZCQRQoGL9pD1N5xzX3DL-ChD1S7STtlInXw)

I recently won a subscription to a really cool, independent publication called [*Geez*](https://geezmagazine.org/), from the good folks at [*The Magnificast*](https://themagnificast.com/). After my subscription runs out, I'll probably donate to keep receiving the magazine because I hate fluff and magazines that are 75% advertisements. 

## Watching

I caved in and watched the first season of *Fleabag*. I honestly can't relate to the main character at all; in fact, there is little for me to connect with in the show, but I can see how it is popular with many other folks. Fleabag has some real, human struggles and an odd, sometimes witty sense of humor.

Until next week!
