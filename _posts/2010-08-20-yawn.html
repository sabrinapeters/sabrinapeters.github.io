<p>Tell yourself you <em>really </em>don't want OR need to read this.  Tell yourself it's a complete waste of time!  Boring!  Sleep-inducing!  Truly!</p>
<p>Consider yourself warned, then I shall proceed.</p>
<p>1) Are you still reading?  Go away!</p>
<p>2)  I had this gut feeling (whatever you want to call it)  that this year would be different from the past few years, and by golly, my gut was right.  I've got a new job I'll absolutely love, dear friends old and new, a cute place to live, and for better or worse, a new and different grad school that is partially the same as it has always been.  Oh, and I made the student council.  Look out, world.</p>
<p>3) Not to mention new ministry opportunities.  The ESL students at church are going through <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Living-Book-Howard-Hendricks/dp/0802408168">Living by the Book</a></em>, and I get to help teach!  I'm excited to see what else I can pack into my schedule....right.</p>
<p>4) Still reading?  There's no hope for you, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>5) Last, but certainly NOT least, Roomie is getting married to Rascal tomorrow.  Never thought I'd live to experience the day(s) of living with a preoccupied, bedazzled, forgetful, bride-to-be.  Okay, well, that is not entirely true.  I figured these kinds of days would come soon enough.  I'm nearing 30 quite rapidly, after all.</p>
<p>6)  <em>STILL</em> reading?!?!  I sentence you to at least a two sentence comment!  There!</p>
