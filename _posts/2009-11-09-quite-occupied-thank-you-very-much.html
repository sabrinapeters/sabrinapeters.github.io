<p>Sorry, friends.  Faithful few.  You'll be lucky to get a new blog before the year's up.  Well, besides this one, but this one hardly counts.  This one is just a courtesy.  This one will only take me a few minutes to type.</p>
<p>But, back to my blog post heading.  I've got work; choir, ESL ministry; a 20 page paper to write dealing with the intertexuality of Hannah's song, David's song in 2 Samuel 22, and Mary's Magnificat in Luke; three exams, and at least several hundred pages to read in about a month's time.</p>
<p>I'll get back to you in due time.  I know you're patient.  :)</p>
