<p><strong>Mia: </strong>Don't you hate that?<br />
<strong>Vincent:</strong> What?<br />
<strong>Mia</strong>: Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about [blankityblank]  in order to be comfortable? <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Vincent: </strong>I don't know. That's a good question.<br />
<strong>Mia</strong>:  That's when you know you've found somebody special. When you can just  shut the [blankityblank] up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence. ﻿</p>
<p>I probably wouldn't have put it precisely that way, but I agree wholeheartedly.  There are not many who treasure silence anymore, especially in this cultureless culture.  I grow weary of small talk.  It exhausts me. In a circle of people, I am more often than not the listener and observer, and thus become labeled as the Shy One.  (Which is not accurate, by the way; there is a difference between shyness and introvert tendencies.  That is a whole 'nother post.  I digress.)</p>
<p>I would rather listen, think, and then speak a few worthwhile words, rather than just filling the air with bubbles to pop.  I don't know; maybe it's the introvert inside of me, maybe it is my infant cynicism, perhaps some of both.   But I think it would do many of us some good to just shut up once in a while, and not just when you are in the presence of that someone special.</p>
<p>*Just for the record, I wouldn't recommend <em>Pulp Fiction </em>to everyone.  When it comes to Tarantino, I watch for form (brilliant form, at that) rather than content.</p>
