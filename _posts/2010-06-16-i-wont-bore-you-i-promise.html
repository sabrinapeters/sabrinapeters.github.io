<p>Today, I:</p>
<p>-tripped and fell, whilst carrying a 30+lb box o' books.  The box saved me.  Think of it as a shield of sorts.</p>
<p>-cut my finger with an exacto knife.</p>
<p>-locked my car key (and wallet, etc.) in my car.  It was still hanging from the ignition.  And the only reason I noticed my keys were missing was because I needed to unlock ze auto to pop the hood.  Why did I need to pop the hood?  Why, to jump start ze auto, of course.  Why did I need to jump start ze auto?  Duh.  <em>(I think it's a malfunctioning starter.)</em> The only thing I had not locked my car was my phone.  Thank God for friends!</p>
