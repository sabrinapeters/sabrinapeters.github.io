<p>So many of them!</p>
<p>-New state, new city, new people.<br />
-Graduate level studies, as opposed to undergrad.<br />
-Living with just one roommate in a quaint apartment, as opposed to living with five or six other people in a house, or 79 other girls in a dormitory.<br />
-Having to actually pay rent (I worked for a room previously).<br />
-Looking for a new church in a completely different environment (I've heard it said that Pierce County [where I now reside], is the least churched county in the entire nation; although I haven't been able to verify that, I've noticed that most churches seem to have smaller congregations).<br />
-Trying to change my Southern California driving instincts is not so easy.<br />
-And for the sake of my family and many friends back in California, I'll make this blog more of a personal chronicle, along with my usual random stuff.</p>
<p>....did I mention the weather is in stark contrast to California right now?  I love this weather.</p>
