<p>I know I'm a little late in the ball game, but I'm currently reading <em>The Shack</em>, by William Young, and am over halfway through the book. Â (For those of you who may not know, this book was selling among Christian circles like hot cakes last year, as number one on the bestseller list.)</p>
<p>I kinda like it, and kinda don't.</p>
<p>Next week I will have a review up, and you will know why I have mixed feelings.</p>
