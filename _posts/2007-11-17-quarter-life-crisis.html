<p>I am driving up 85 in the<br />
Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon<br />
I'm just stuck inside the gloom</p>
<p>4 more exits to my apartment but<br />
I am tempted to keep the car in drive<br />
And leave it all behind</p>
<p>Cause I wonder sometimes<br />
About the outcome<br />
Of a still verdictless life<br />
Am I living it right<br />
Am I living it right<br />
Am I living it right<br />
Why, why georgia, why</p>
<p>I rent a room and I fill the spaces with<br />
Wood in places to make it feel like home<br />
But all I feel alone</p>
<p>It might be a quarter-life crisis<br />
Or just the stirring in my soul<br />
Either way</p>
<p>I wonder sometimes<br />
About the outcome<br />
Of a still verdictless life<br />
Am I living it right<br />
Am I living it right<br />
Am I living it right<br />
Why, why georgia, why</p>
<p>So what so I've got a smile on<br />
It's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head</p>
<p>Don't believe me<br />
Don't believe me<br />
When I say I've got it down</p>
<p>Everybody is just a stranger<br />
But that's the danger in going my own way<br />
I guess it's a price I have to pay<br />
Still everything happens for a reason<br />
Is no reason not to ask myself<br />
If I'm living it right</p>
<p>Am I living it right<br />
Am I living it right<br />
Why, why georgia, why</p>
