<p>you know, the more weddings i go to, the more expensive &amp; elaborate they seem.  i told my mom that the more weddings i attend, the less i want to have one.</p>
<p>i seriously wouldn't mind just eloping, and then throwing a party later.  why not use the money for a good cause?</p>
<p>but then i would have some pretty annoyed friends... and not to mention, family.  likewise, there are more than a few people who would say marriage involves community, and including one's community as a witness of the marriage covenant is a non negotiable.</p>
<p>thoughts?</p>
