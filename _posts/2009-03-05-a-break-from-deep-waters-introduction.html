<p>In other words, a break from my deep thinking.</p>
<p>I got to thinking (ha!), that maybe a few readers would like some light stuff, some stuff that is actual literal in content, instead of imagery and metaphors.  Such a concept, I know.  I also must apologize, because I have found myself to be hypocritical in the blogging etiquette department, in that I have demanded (in my mind, but it still counts), at least two or three blog entries per week from each blogger on my blogroll, yet I can only seem to conjure up something every two to three weeks.  Woe to me.</p>
<p>So, within this series of "a break from deep waters", I will attempt to blog on <b>things that I like</b>.  That will consequently give you a peek into my life, so beware!</p>
<p>I will definitely blog on food and books, because they are most essential to life, besides God, of course (how could you even think anything else!  I am ashamed).  I will also attempt to explain the blogs on my blogroll, but I have another idea.</p>
<p>Drum roll, please.</p>
<p>If you are one of the four people (taking a stab in the dark with this number, because I really have no clue, but you know who you are) who regularly peruse my blog (even if you never comment...now is the time!), perhaps you might <b>suggest a topic or two from my "i am" page</b> (any topic which you see there, because, presumably, I like those things) and I shall grant you your heart's desire with a blog entry on that topic.  The quality of the blog, however, might be for you to determine, haha.  Just kidding on that part.  I will try my very best.</p>
<p>Have at it!</p>
