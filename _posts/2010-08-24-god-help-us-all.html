<p>..I'm actually going to need a semi-grown-up planner for this upcoming school year.  No more of those simple monthly spreads.</p>
<p>I have this perspicuous reminder in front of me ; I'm getting older, and I forget more things every school year.</p>
<p>Ergo, the planner.</p>
<p>Dang it, I knew I shouldn't have already made a rough time map, but as they say about me, curiosity kills.  (I have a million lives, though, so no worries there.)</p>
