<p>I have a thing for metaphors.</p>
<p>After I had quite the nerdy discussion with someone about similes versus metaphors, I got to thinking about why I like metaphors so much (yes, RB, those include similes ;)).</p>
<p>Here's what I came up with.</p>
<p>1) We use them everyday, and don't even realize it.</p>
<p>2) Because the imagery provoked by the metaphor communicates much better than just a sentence with adjectives, a sentence interpreted according to literal definitions and syntax, and I'm a visual person. (You could say that all words have their connotations and thus provoke a certain imagery, but I'm speaking of pictures.  You know what I mean...a picture paints a thousand words, right?)  This is the main reason I use metaphors in poetry so often.</p>
<p>3) They make me think, and if you know me well, you know I like to think.  A lot.</p>
<p>The <strong>problem</strong> with metaphors, though, especially with many literary pieces (and this is why I scored higher in the math section of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBEST">CBEST</a> than on the reading section...stupid multiple possible interpretations!), is that they sometimes contain <em>so many </em>different possible interpretations, one could spend <em>years </em>debating.  But guess what?  Most likely (meaning, there are exceptions), you will never know the real meaning and intent of the metaphor unless you are the author of said metaphor.</p>
<p>So, the very thing I love about metaphors is the very thing that sometimes annoys the crap out of me.  What gives?</p>
