<p>i feel as though i've reached one pinnacle in my cynicism and loathing of consumerism.  nope, no christmas gifts for you.  at least, not the kind that you think.</p>
<p>it's a fairly romantic and tragic irony....because i work in "christian retail", and it is now the busiest season for those businesses.  i'm supposed to be selling stuff, not complaining about stuff.</p>
