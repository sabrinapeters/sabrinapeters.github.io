<p>If you have not played around on Noise Trade, go <a href="http://www.noisetrade.com">now</a>.</p>
<p>Two words:  Free.  Music.</p>
<p>Alot of the stuff is indie music, but it's good indie music.  You'll also find many samplers of more well-known artists.</p>
<p>Okay, 'nough said.  Stop reading and<a href="http://www.noisetrade.com"> go play</a>.  :)</p>
