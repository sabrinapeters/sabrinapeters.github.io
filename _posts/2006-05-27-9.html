<blockquote><p>Do you see, do you see<br />
All the people sinking down<br />
Don't you care, don't you care<br />
Are you gonna let them drown </p>
<p>How can you be so numb<br />
Not to care if they come<br />
You close your eyes<br />
And pretend the job's done</p>
<p>"Oh bless me Lord, bless me Lord"<br />
You know it's all I ever hear<br />
No one aches, no one hurts<br />
No one even sheds one tear</p>
<p>But He cries, He weeps, He bleeds<br />
And He cares for your needs<br />
And you just lay back<br />
And keep soaking it in,<br />
Oh, can't you see it's such a sin?</p>
<p>Cause He brings people to you door,<br />
And you turn them away<br />
As you smile and say,<br />
"God bless you, be at peace"<br />
And all heaven just weeps<br />
Cause Jesus came to you door<br />
You've left him out on the streets</p>
<p>Open up open up<br />
And give yourself away<br />
You see the need, you hear the cries<br />
So how can you delay</p>
<p>God's calling and you're the one<br />
But like Jonah you run<br />
He's told you to speak<br />
But you keep holding it in,<br />
Oh can't you see it's such a sin?</p>
<p>The world is sleeping in the dark<br />
That the church just can't fight<br />
Cause it's asleep in the light<br />
How can you be so dead<br />
When you've been so well fed<br />
Jesus rose from the grave<br />
And you, you can't even get out of bed</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus rose from the dead<br />
Come on, get out of your bed</p>
<p>How can you be so numb<br />
Not to care if they come<br />
You close your eyes<br />
And pretend the job's done<br />
You close your eyes<br />
And pretend the job's done</p>
<p>Don't close your eyes<br />
Don't pretend the jobs done<br />
Come away, come away, come away with Me my love,<br />
Come away, from this mess, come away with Me, my love.</p></blockquote>
