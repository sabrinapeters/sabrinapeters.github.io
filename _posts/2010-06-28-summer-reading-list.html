<p>I actually don't have a list written out, just some things in mind that I'd like to have read by the end of summer.  But I call it my summer reading list, anyway, just to make myself feel good.  ;)</p>
<p><strong>Currently reading</strong> (I have book ADD, so help me)<strong>:</strong></p>
<p><em>Leave Me Alone, I'm Reading </em>by Maureen Corrigan.  A literature professor reflects upon her life in relation to different plots/themes found in literature.  Only a couple chapters in so far; so far, a pleasure.</p>
<p><em>Things Fall Apart b</em>y Chinua Achebe.  Been meaning to finish this one for a while.  It's not often I get to read a novel authored by a non-Westerner, and an excellent one at that.</p>
<p><em>Sense and Sensibility. </em>'nough said.</p>
<p><em>The Betrayal</em> by Douglas Bond.  A historical novel on John Calvin.  I haven't read a good "Christian" historical fiction work in quite a while, and I am really enjoying this one.  Calvin?  Yes.  I am a seminary  nerd.</p>
<p><em>The Bible and the Future </em>by Anthony Hoekema.  Thanks to a theological conversation partner, Doyle, for recommending this one.  Finally, a book on eschatology NOT given from a dispensational premillennial view.  Something to chew on.</p>
<p><strong>Next up:</strong></p>
<p><em>Vintage Church </em>by Mark Driscoll.</p>
<p><em>The Thing Around Your Neck </em>by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.</p>
<p><em>A Million Miles in a Thousand Years </em>by Don Miller.</p>
<p>Anything else I should be reading?</p>
<p>What are you reading this summer?</p>
