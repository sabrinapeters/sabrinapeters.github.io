<p>Okay, so, I know that "Christians" aren't supposed to have "pet peeves", because we're supposedly supposed to have the patience of saints, or whatever.  BUT</p>
<p>I have a pet peeve of the year, if you can call it that.  And since I've no energy to do anything physical and not enough mental energy to do heavy thinking, I might as well do something slightly mental and write something frivolous.   Thus, I will write about my pet peeve of the year, and that is (drum roll, please!)...</p>
<p>Washingtonian driving (no offense to those amongst my friends who might actually drive this way)!</p>
<p>Let me clarify before you start laughing at me.</p>
<p>1) "Washingtonian driving" usually means the majority of people who grew up in WA, and learned how to drive in WA.</p>
<p>2)  I realize there are exceptions.</p>
<p>Having settled all that, let's get cracking.  There are several pet peeves contained within this one pet peeve, and I will illustrate them for you.</p>
<p><em>Four-way stops. </em>Yes, you all have the "stopping" part down, peoples, and even though this is coming from a Southern Californian, it's true.  You stop.  And stay stopped, wondering, "is it my turn?  Should I go?  Okay, I'll go.  Oh, wait, that person moved, so I'll stop and let them go.  Okay, my turn now? Oh, wait..."  Um, you've heard of right-of-way?  'Cause I use it, and I will go when it's my turn, even though there are two of us going the same way, or one of us is going in the opposite direction (much to your bafflement).</p>
<p><em>Freeway interchanges. </em>Just because you are changing freeways does not mean you need to slow down to 35 mph.  We're still on a freeway, folks.</p>
<p><em>Speed limits in dry weather, because they drive as if it's raining all the time</em>.  Hey, did you know that the posted speed limit is not the maximum speed?  In other words, when the speed limit is 50, you can go 55, or even 50.  Please, please, do not go 40 mph.  You're killing me!  And on freeways, it's legit to go <em>65 miles per hour when the speed limit is 60 miles per hour</em>.  Yeah!  Isn't it liberating?</p>
<p><em>Roundabouts</em>.  LOL.  I love roundabouts, even though I had never encountered them before I moved to Tacoma for the first time.  But the funny thing is, people think they have to stop <em>before </em>they enter the thing.</p>
<p><em>Four way intersections in which there are no stop signs; only "yield" signs. </em>Are you sure you're not confusing those "yield" signs with "stop" signs?  Maybe "California stops" would come in handy here.</p>
<p><em>Driving in snow</em>.  Ha, ha.  I won't even go there.</p>
<p><em>Passing. </em>Yes, it is okay to pass, just so you know.  I will pass if I can (more often than not, however, all four lanes across the freeway are blocked by drivers all. going. the. same. rate).</p>
<p>Okay, those are the main parts of the pet peeve.  I know some of you can relate to my frustration in this matter, so feel free to add to the list.  ;)</p>
<p>To kind of balance out the silliness of this post, I will now kindly point you to a very non-silly and extremely thought-provoking post by a fellow seminary student <a href="http://confusionatahigherlevel.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-wonder-as-i-wander.html"><span style="color:#99cc00;">here</span></a><span style="color:#99cc00;">,</span> on the current state of the church in America (mostly in relation to culture/missions), and what it might look like in the future (post-Christian America?).  I might even take that topic and run with it on here in the near future, if time allows.  Enjoy!</p>
