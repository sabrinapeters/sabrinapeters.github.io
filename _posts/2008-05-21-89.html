<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;font-size:small;">“Solitude enables us to care again. Without an element of solitude there can be no compassion because when a person is lost in the wheels of a social machine he or she is no longer aware of human needs as a matter of social responsibility.”</span></p>
