<p>I am tempted not to make a New Year's resolution, because I never keep them.  And I rarely hear of someone who does.  Sad, huh? ;)  Instead, I'm going to renew and refresh some resolutions I should be keeping for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Keep small stuff the small stuff, invest more in people, use my time wisely, love God more with my intellect, actions, and emotions, pray.</p>
<p>And maybe even write more on this blog.  :)</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
