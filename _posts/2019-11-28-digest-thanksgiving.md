It's Turkey Day, AKA Thanksgiving Day, AKA National Day of Mourning. 

We've spent Tuesday and most of Wednesday traveling. Tuesday was a 5 hour plane ride, and I catnapped throughout most of it, abandoning my ambitious plan to continue reading [Zinn](https://sdrp.me/2019/11/15/weekly-digest-fourteen/). Today, however, was a pleasant, 3 hour train ride, and I was able to catch up on some articles and a podcast episode (okay, to be honest, I did listen to a podcast on the plane, but I also fell asleep during it ðŸ™„).

On another note, I have discovered a rather painful way to fix mild jet lag. For a flight that jumps ahead two time zones, I need to: 

1. Sleep little or not at all the night before, continuing a pattern of sleep-deprivation from the week prior.
2. Eat hardly anything all day.
3. Get on an early-ish flight.
4. Land at destination in time to have an early dinner
5. Fight a burgeoning headache until an acceptable early bedtime (in my case it was 8 p.m.).
6. Wake up after 5 hours of sleep, take diphenhydramine (I took it on an empty stomach; do not recommend), and fall back asleep after playing solitaire for an hour.
7. Wake up at a semi-reasonable hour for the time zone I'm in.
8. Feel okay-ish for the rest of the day.

Back to business. In this week's digest, I'm including all the articles I read yesterday related to Thanksgiving Day origins and myths, with short explanations. I hope they are helpful.

This article is written by a Native American on how she chooses to celebrate T. Day.
