<p>I stated before that I do not make a habit of debating politics.</p>
<p>Just in case you forgot.</p>
<p>However, consider this quote from the President regarding last night's historical event (via Twitter.  Yes, you can follow the prez on twitter, and it's not his teleprompter, either).</p>
<p>"This is major reform.  This is what change looks like."</p>
<p>No freakin' way, really?  Remind me again...what does change look like?</p>
<p>Wow, do we have a candidate for Captain Obvious.</p>
<p>(I am not going to argue for or against the health care reform bill, by the way.  No comments here.  You can discuss/debate all you want, but I won't be included.  That's not the point.)</p>
