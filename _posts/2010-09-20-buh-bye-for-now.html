<p>The craziness of autumn all begins tomorrow.  I think I have mentioned some of this before.  Well, it has arrived.  It's really, truly here.</p>
<p>~hamartiology and soteriology<br />
~pastoral epistles<br />
.....<br />
along with:<br />
~music, music, music.  with bo'b, and with the worship team<br />
~ESL teaching (oh, poor students)<br />
~teaching little ones<br />
~student council<br />
~oh, and I almost forgot: working<br />
~additional miscellany as it comes along</p>
<p>Catch me on twitter, FB, or skype, not to mention e-mail.</p>
<p>Au revoir.</p>
