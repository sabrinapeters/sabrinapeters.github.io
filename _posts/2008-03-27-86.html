<p><em>Art and the Bible </em><br />
p16</p>
<p>"...if Christianity is really true, then it involves the whole man, including his intellect and creativeness.<br />
Christianity is not <em>just </em>'dogmatically' true or 'doctrinally' true.<br />
Rather, it is true to what is there, true in the whole area of the whole man in all of life."</p>
