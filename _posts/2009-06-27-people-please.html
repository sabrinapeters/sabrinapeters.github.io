<p>I usually don't make strong political statements, because I dislike stirring up debate.   Even so, this is not considered a "strong political statement", but I needed to get some stuff off my chest.  And this is not directed at anyone in particular, so please do not feel that I am targeting you.</p>
<p>People, please...</p>
<p>Are right-wing, conservative, Republican politics really the gospel?  I've yet to see someone effectively evangelized or converted by the forcing of right-wing politics down their throat, especially when the arguments are primarily ad hominem.</p>
<p>Change begins on the inside, and works its way out.  The reverse is not true.</p>
<p>Also, please do not think that just because I am a "Christian", it means I am a Republican, or should be a Republican.  I do not wish to adopt political parties mindlessly, simply because it is the trend amongst those with beliefs similar to mine.  I do not think that the GOP is the elect political party.</p>
<p>Okay, the end (I hope).</p>
