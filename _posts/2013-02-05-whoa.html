<p>Hello, and welcome to my new blogging site! My "old" blog page won't be deleted, but I won't use it anymore, so bookmark this page if you're interested. I am currently sick with what seems to be a sinus infection/cold, but once I am fully recovered, you can expect my usual content, plus, I am brainstorming for a couple of new blog series (if you have a topic you'd like to see covered someday, read my About page, and then comment below), and will be adding more book reviews. I still have a separate poetry page for now: <a href="http://notemily.wordpress.com">http://not-emily.wordpress.com</a></p>
<p>That's enough about me. :)  How are you this Tuesday?  How did January 2013 treat you?  What is different about 2013 than 2012?</p>
