<p>Since I have been dealing with headaches and the temporary loss of my dear MacBook, I can now identify with Kuzco in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emperors-New-Groove/dp/B000AAF1U4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1244163155&amp;sr=8-1">The Emperor's New Groove</a><span style="font-style:normal;">:  "DAHHH!  You threw off my groove!!"  My blogging groove, that is.</span></em> Thus, a plug for some cool blogs is coming right up.  See the previous plugs <a href="http://pensamientosconfusos.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/from-the-blogging-universe/">here</a> and <a href="http://pensamientosconfusos.wordpress.com/2009/05/02/from-the-blogging-universe-2">here</a> if you missed them.</p>
<p>Did I mention it was raining yesterday?  And thundering?  I love it.  Technically, it's not summer, but I love summer storms.  That's ONE thing I like about the freakish high desert.</p>
<p>Not many of you have voted on the <a href="http://pensamientosconfusos.wordpress.com/2009/05/16/pickles/">pickles poll</a>.  I would like to post the results soon, but I need more participants.  Then I will another poll.  And perhaps another.  ;-)</p>
<p>Okay, now down to business.</p>
<p>For your smile/laugh of the day, visit  <a href="http://chazandjack.wordpress.com">The Adventures of Chaz and Jack</a>.  It's a comic based on real experiences as clerks in a Christian retail store.  Also, you might get a kick out of <a href="http://www.habitationofjustice.com">The Habitation of Justice</a> (he doesn't write funny stuff <em>all </em>the time, but when it's funny, it's hilariously funny).  I also recently discovered <a href="http://www.stuffchristianslike.net">Stuff Christians Like </a>(I'm guessing the idea comes from <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuff_White_People_Like">Stuff White People Like</a></em>), thanks to my blogging friend <a href="http://ohmysweetcarolina.wordpress.com">Caroline</a>.  Side-splitting!</p>
<p>Check 'em out!</p>
