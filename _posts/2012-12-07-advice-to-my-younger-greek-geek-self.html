<p>Just for fun, here are some things I wish I had taken to heart, back when I was a young biblical languages student (and, really, some of this can apply to any Bible student, not just the Greek geeks).</p>
<p>1) Work hard.  A good grade doesn't mean you've mastered it.  At the same time, try to get more sleep. :)  It actually helps.</p>
<p>2) Greek isn't everything.  Neither is Hebrew.  Don't get hung up on parsings and definitions unless <em>absolutely necessary</em>.  You might find that it's more seldom than you thought.</p>
<p>3) Watch your pride.  Who do you think you are? Pride sneaks up on the best ones, and even leaks out in a humble form. I mean, you gotta admit that you're always looking for subtle ways to impress with your language skills:  <em>Listening to someone trying to explain John 1:1 in their story of an encounter with JWs, and they obviously don't know Koine Greek.</em> "Oh yeah, uh, I know a little bit of Greek."  "REALLY?  You must be so smart!  Can you read fluently? Can <em>you</em> explain the Greek in John 1.1?!  What about in John 21.15-17? "  <em>They take out their Bible, and flip to a favorite New Testament passage. "</em>What does the Greek say here?" <em>As though it really makes a great difference, heh heh.  I know better. </em> *<em>Pats self on back.* </em> Being a languages geek doesn't put you above everybody else.  Stop it.</p>
<p>4) Just because that preacher didn't get his Greek right, does not mean his sermon has been completely spoiled.  Be kind, not critical.</p>
<p>5) Just because that preacher didn't insert a comment about the original language into his sermon, does not make him inferior.</p>
<p>6) Stop stressing out about getting perfect answers 100% of the time, and enjoy the learning experience.</p>
<p>7) I know you hear it all the time, but seriously, if you don't practice/use Hebrew and Greek, you'll lose them.  So, if you want to retain anything, practice it.  Keep reading it.  There are no other substitutes.</p>
