This will be short and sweet, but I wanted to let you all know about my very first podcast appearance (can it be an appearance when you don't see me?), in which I have the privilege of chatting with the [Rev. Lauren R.E. Larkin](http://www.laurenrelarkin.com) for her podcast Sancta Colloquia [about _Our God Loves Justice_.](https://laurenrelarkin.com/2019/05/26/sancta-colloquia-episode-109-talkin-our-god-loves-justice-by-dr-w-travis-mcmaken-ft-sabrina-peters/)

In it you'll hear some of my thoughts on Christians, dialectical theology, socialism, the [kyriarchy](http://sdrp.me/2018/01/04/kyriarchy), women's health, and more. I really enjoyed chatting with Lauren and would love to chat with you about these things, as well!  Find the [episode](https://laurenrelarkin.com/2019/05/26/sancta-colloquia-episode-109-talkin-our-god-loves-justice-by-dr-w-travis-mcmaken-ft-sabrina-peters/) wherever you listen to your podcasts, so we can start the conversation.
