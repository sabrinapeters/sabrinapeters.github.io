Hello, fellow life-travelers. Not sure about you, but it's been a doozy of a week for me. In addition to some annoying chronic illness symptoms resurfacing, I've done a lot of what I call, "peopleing". Including Sunday, I've been to five group/social events at church. I usually keep it to twice weekly if I can help it, but, I'm trying to push myself to give C a little introvert time when he comes home from work. True introvert time  for two introverts is hard to come by in a small living situation. Anyhow, this was in addition to volunteering at a local LGBTQ resource center on Wednesdays. So, when I tried to write this little digest yesterday, I found myself falling asleep at the desk and decided to finish the one podcast I'd managed to listen to this week. 

Speaking of podcasts, I've got a little app up and running (actually, C did the difficult part; I know nothing about programming web applications) to take your email address for podcast updates! Check out [*Seminary for the Rest of Us*](https://seminary.show). (If you do sign up, make sure to check your junk/spam for the confirmation email. It doesn't always go there, but it has for some email providers.)

My "Sunday Reflections" this week was a little meditation about why people go to church on Sundays: ["Sunday Reflections, vol. 3"](https://sdrp.me/2019/11/19/sunday-reflection-three/).

With that, let's mix up the order of the rest again.

## Watching

I watched the third season of *The Crown* this week. It is brilliantly done television, but each time a next season comes out and I watch it, I come to increasingly despise British monarchy. I would say monarchy in general is a bad idea. The episode that struck me the most was the third, on the [Aberfan disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberfan_disaster). My second favorite episode is probably the sixth episode when Prince Charles stays in Wales for a couple months before his investiture. 

## Reading

### Books

I'm still working my way through *The People's History of the United States* and am still in need of picking up a novel to balance it out. I have a couple in mind, but I won't bar any suggestions.

### Articles and miscellanea

There is one statement in here that I quibble with, but is otherwise worth pondering how Christianity has historically vilified Jewish people: ["Centuries of Christian anti-Semitism led to Holocaust, landmark Church of England report concludes"](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/21/centuries-christian-anti-semitism-led-holocaust-landmark-church/?WT.mc_id=tmg_share_tw).

An article on some Syrian refugees in Jordan, mostly from the perspective of mothers: ["The Conundrum of Return to Syria"](http://anthrowcircus.com/the-conundrum-of-return)

An article on the real dangers of nouthetic (i.e., "biblical") counseling (note: if you have had experience with being counseled by a nouthetic counselor following abuse of any kind, it may be triggering): ["When Restoration Hurts"](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/december/when-restoration-hurts-christian-counseling-abuse.html?share=xFXGxdzFMcUK0ZRAUIYKbEC6nrW5KqIs&fbclid=IwAR2UMVvVp7gR15yjrj7nL_Ft5hbb8enhsjRt2srgaaSASMYOCV4WCZOwTH8).


## Listening

## Podcasts

I finally got around to the *The Magnificast* episode with Heath Carter about Evangelicalism. It is not optimistic, but it helps to have historical, social, and political context. Find it wherever you listen to podcasts, or this link: ["So, What's the Deal with Evangelicalism?"](https://player.fm/series/the-magnificast-2528501/so-whats-the-deal-with-evangelicalism-w-heath-carter)

## Music

I tried listening to Billie Eilish the other day and I got bored. I don't understand the hype.

I found a new track from Alicia Keys, though, and it did not disappoint: ["Time Machine"](https://open.spotify.com/album/6AyIocBD7P3K6vjTK6Vg0b?si=Rh6RKWbnRRSQILu7useDRQ)

Also, Audrey Assad has a new Advent album out. I've heard maybe one or two tracks and liked them, so I expect I'll be listening a lot next month!: [*Peace*](https://open.spotify.com/album/71utF7ZcnGv0CqmdIEAPgn?si=B0niLPkFS5ucKWXM3tvhkQ)
