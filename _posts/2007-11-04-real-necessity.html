<p>That moment was so peaceful, I can’t even begin to describe it.</p>
<p>Outside, overlooking the water.</p>
<p>Accompanied by autumn colored trees, blue sky, white clouds and sunshine.</p>
<p>While breathing prayers, a wave of calm washed over me.  My anxieties dissipated.</p>
<p>No wonder Jesus sought time in communion with the Father, alone, for hours at a time.  You can’t run through life without stopping to even have a time of <span style="font-style:italic;">thought</span> in solitude, let alone <span style="font-style:italic;">prayer</span>, which goes without saying.  But even with preaching that last phrase, I would be the biggest hypocrite.</p>
<p>I am sorely lacking, and utterly prideful, to think I could proceed on my own.</p>
