<p>I've now been living in Tacoma, WA for 10 days.</p>
<p>After I unpacked all my books, I started to feel at home, although I don't know where I'll keep the books I collect while in my three-year seminary experience (I think I may decorate this little place with bookshelves).  That "at-home" feeling grew as I became more able to navigate around "T-town", so they call it.  And tonight I cooked my first meal, so I'm feeling mostly settled.</p>
<p>My family hung out with me last week, and we had fun going places and doing things.</p>
<p>Out of my unending curiosity for churches "emerging", I visited <a href="http://www.somacommunities.com">Soma church.</a> This area has a wealth of Baptist churches, and what seems to be popular are GARBC churches ("GARB", as everyone calls them: General Association for Regular Baptist  Churches).  I tend to feel uncomfortable in denominational churches with a strict doctrinal statement (which is why I like <a href="http://www.efca.org">EV Free churches</a>-their doctrinal statement has room for a bit of freedom), so I don't know whether I'll end up in a Baptist church or not.  I liked Soma, but I suspect it'll take more than a couple attendances to know what they are really up to.</p>
<p>I'll be taking a summer class, <span style="font-style:italic;">Interpretive Insights from the Land of the Bible</span>.  It's basically a Bible geography course, the closest thing to an excursion to Israel for me, I suppose, although I still long for a trip to the Holy Land.  It's two weeks in length, so we'll see how much I actually retain.</p>
<p>For the fall quarter, I'll be taking Greek, Hebrew, Hermeneutics, and Theological Research &amp; Writing.</p>
<p>I have a hunch I've landed a job at the local Christian bookstore.  It won't be paying much, but it's a start.  I'm not in control of my own life, and I was sorely reminded of that fact when in a slight occurrence of absent-mindedness, I locked myself out of my car at a gas station, with nothing in my hands except a skinny gas card.  Another story for another time.</p>
<p>At any rate, God has seen it fit to keep me here, and He'll continue to provide as He sees fit.</p>
