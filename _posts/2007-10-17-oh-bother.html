<p>Dang it.</p>
<p>It is too easy to let things slip even a little.</p>
<p>Taking my gaze off the goal, and letting it linger off to the side for what seems to be a short time, only to find that when I try to fix my gaze back on the goal, a spoon of discontentment has already been fed to my mind, heart.</p>
<p>That distraction leads to a complete, 100% lackadaisical approach to the here and now, which in turn leads to poor stewardship of the gifts I have been loaned to use where I am, right now.</p>
<p>I feel utterly <span style="font-style:italic;">un</span>motivated to do anything right now.  And it's all my fault.  And it's sin.</p>
