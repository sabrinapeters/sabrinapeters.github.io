<p>Well, my class has been over for a couple weeks.  I certainly learned quite a bit about biblical geography.</p>
<p>I have a paper due at the end of this month for that class.  I chose to write about David and Goliath and how geography impacted this encounter...but I'm having a difficult time finding enough information.  I could probably wing it by being extremely detailed, but still...</p>
<p>...any ideas are welcome.</p>
