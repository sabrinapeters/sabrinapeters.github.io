<p>Last night I read a very thoughtful summary of the need for contextualization, and think it would behoove you to read it, as well.</p>
<p>Here's the blog link: <a href="http://kendru.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/culture-is-not-evil/">Soli Deo Gloria</a></p>
<p>If you could comment on Andrew's blog, that would be swell, but you could also share your thoughts here, too, if you'd rather. Â :)</p>
