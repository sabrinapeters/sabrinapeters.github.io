<p>i wish i could help anyone i wanted.</p>
<p>i wish i could buy meals for anyone who asks.</p>
<p>i wish i could loan money without the worry of repayment.</p>
<p>i wish i could actually act on what i see rather than what society tells me is the reality.</p>
<p>i wish i could believe every person i talked to, but i can't.  i can't even trust myself.</p>
