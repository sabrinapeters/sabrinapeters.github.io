I just discovered that there are two different prominent churches in the States with the name "Mars Hill".

I am afraid that before a few days ago, when I was reading A New Kind of Christian, I had confused the two churches.

I got a feel for Mars Hill in Seattle when I visited, and think that I would be content there, but I'm not so sure about Mars Hill Bible Church.
