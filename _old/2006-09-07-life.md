Well, now that school has officially begun, the struggle to update my blog with thoughful blurbs has now intensified. I am taking five classes,  
\-Exegesis of Romans (DrV is by far my most favorite professor)  
\-Early Christian Literature (see above)  
\-Senior Seminar  
\-Foundations of Science  
\-Message Preparation for Women (incidentally, we will be giving messages from Philippians, which I studied last semester in my Greek exegesis class).

Aside from these classes, I will be studying for the GRE and the senior competency bible exam.

I miss not having two Greek classes. Romans is my last Greek class, and the only one I am taking this semester.
