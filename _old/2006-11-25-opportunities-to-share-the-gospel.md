I've been using the gospel of Judas to my advantage, not to mention the gospel of Thomas.

I've been encouraged by the fact that even though the early Apologists could utilize almost any type of argument in the apologia of Christianity, they always pointed to the character of the Christians. In another way, this also causes some disappointment within me, because the Christians whose character is not so Christ-like always stick out more. This is why I'm hesitant to use the word "Christian". Any thoughts on that?
