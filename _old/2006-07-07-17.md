Is there a difference between a woman teaching in the church and a woman Bible professor? I saw that Wheaton has a female prof in the Bible department, and it got me thinking. 1 Timothy 2 does not differentiate between school and church, so it seems to be more of a cultural issue...or is it?

School denotes knowledge in of itself, but everyone in a position of leadership has influence in the way of worldview and philosophy, etc. A Bible teacher is always going to have some spiritual influence over his/her students, so does that mean that a female Bible professor would be violating Paul's command?
