I've been reading Exegetical Fallacies lately, and, as my buddy Cliff pointed out, it's the book that makes you think you've committed the very errors of which it speaks. It definitely made me a little nervous, but it's such a good reminder for the treatment of God's Word. When I finish the book, I'll blog a few thoughts.
