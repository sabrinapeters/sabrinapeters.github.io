Here's my first draft, for your enjoyment/criticism/edification/whatever you like:

Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen sojourners of the dispersion throughout Pontus, Galatia, Capadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father by the sanctification of the Spirit, through the obedience of Jesus Christ and sprinkling of His blood, may grace and peace be multiplied unto you.

Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His rich mercy raised us to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, for an inheritance which is incorruptible and pure and unfading, and being kept in heaven for us, which is being guarded by Godâ€™s power through faith, for salvation, ready to be revealed on the last day. In this you rejoice greatly, even though at this present time, for a little while, you are distressed by various trials, so that the testing of your faith, as precious gold ruined by fire, and tested, may be found to the praise and glory and honor in the revelation of Jesus Christ, whom, even though you do not know you love, in whom you believe even though you have not seen Him and rejoice greatly with joy inexpressible and glorious, thereby attaining the outcome of your faith, namely the salvation of your souls.
