<p>Well, now that school has officially begun, the struggle to update my blog with thoughful blurbs has now intensified.  I am taking five classes,<br />
-Exegesis of Romans (DrV is by far my most favorite professor)<br />
-Early Christian Literature (see above)<br />
-Senior Seminar<br />
-Foundations of Science<br />
-Message Preparation for Women (incidentally, we will be giving messages from Philippians, which I studied last semester in my Greek exegesis class).</p>
<p>Aside from these classes, I will be studying for the GRE and the senior competency bible exam.</p>
<p>I miss not having two Greek classes.  Romans is my last Greek class, and the only one I am taking this semester.</p>
