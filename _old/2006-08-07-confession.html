<p>It seems I've been quite the slacker this summer.  I had better intentions for this blog, and I regret now not having put the time that summer normally gives into this blog.  My apologies to the few who would actually read this :).  I hope to get things rolling again this week, although it may be a little slow.</p>
<p>To top things off, I've been unexpectedly :) tagged by Cliff, or as students of DrV(arner) know him, Clive.  :)</p>
<p>1. One book that changed your life.</p>
<p>Well, of course the Bible.  I'm tempted to leave it at that because I have such a hard time making decisions :).  Um, probably <em>Basics of Biblical Greek</em>.</p>
<p>2. One book that you’ve read more than once.</p>
<p>Hehe.  Can I be completely random?  <em>Eating Well for Optimum Health</em></p>
<p>3. One book you’d want on a desert island.</p>
<p>Just one?  How horrible.  That's depressing, if you ask me.  I'd definitely want my Bible.  If I had the entire vocab of the Greek NT memorized I might take that.  Maybe <em> Is There a Meaning in This Text?</em></p>
<p>4. One book that made you laugh.</p>
<p>I remember when I used to read a lot of novels.  With my sense of humor, however, I can usually find something to laugh at in 80% of the books I read.</p>
<p>5. One book that made you cry.</p>
<p>It was probably a novel.</p>
<p>6. One book that you wish had been written.</p>
<p>Well, right now I'm wishing someone would have written a flawless commentary of Revelation.  **EDIT**  According to Cliff (and thank you), flawless commentaries <em>have</em> been written.  So now I have to change my answer.  Or should I?  I don't have an infinite knowledge of books.  Oh, I know.  <em>How to Survive First Year Hebrew with Dr. Boyd</em></p>
<p>7. One book that you wish had never been written.</p>
<p><em>Jesus and Buddha</em></p>
<p>8. One book you’re currently reading.</p>
<p><em>Text of the New Testament</em></p>
<p>9. One book you’ve been meaning to read.</p>
<p>A meaningful book or just a book?  I enjoy being random. <em> A Generous Orthodoxy </em>,  <em>God, Language and Scripture </em>,  <em> Crime and Punishment </em> (which I started, but never finished).</p>
<p>10. Now tag five people.<br />
Who is left to tag?  If you happen to read this and haven't done it yet, consider yourself tagged.</p>
<p>It would seem that the obvious answer to the vast majority of these questions is..."Bible"....hmm...</p>
