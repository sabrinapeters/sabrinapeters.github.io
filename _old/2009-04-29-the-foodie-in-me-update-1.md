I've finally uploaded a recipe onto "the foodie in me" page.  It's a granola that tastes like an oatmeal raisin cookie.  If you appreciate an oatmeal raisin cookie, you will love how this granola tastes.  If you don't like raisins, well, I pity you, but if you must leave them out, so be it.  At any rate, bon appetit!
