<p>I just discovered that there are two different prominent churches in the States with the name "Mars Hill".</p>
<p>I am afraid that before a few days ago, when I was reading <span style="font-style:italic;">A New Kind of Christian, </span>I had confused the two churches.</p>
<p>I got a feel for Mars Hill in Seattle when I visited, and think that I would be content there, but I'm not so sure about Mars Hill Bible Church.</p>
