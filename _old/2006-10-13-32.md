**Your Blogging Type is Pensive and Philosophical**  

![](http://images.blogthings.com/whatsyourbloggingpersonalityquiz/pensive.jpg)  
  
You blog like no one else is reading...Â

Easy going and flexible, you tend to befriend other bloggers easily.

But if they disagree with once too much, you'll pull them from your blogroll!
